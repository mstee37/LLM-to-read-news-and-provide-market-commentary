Rowe Price\nHome\nResources\nInsights\nGlobal markets weekly update\nmarkets & economy\n|  JANUARY 31, 2025\nGlobal markets weekly update\nECB reduces rates while the Fed holds steady\nHighlighted Regions\nU.S.\nEurope\nJapan\nChina\nOther Key Markets\nU.S.\nCorporate earnings and AI competition fears leave stocks lower after volatile week\nU.S. stocks finished the volatile week mostly lower, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose modestly to notch its third straight week of gains. The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite experienced a particularly steep drop on Monday, driven by a sell-off in tech stocks in response to the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) developer. DeepSeek released a new open-source large language model that reportedly requires much less energy and processing power than other leading AI applications, leading to competitive concerns in the broader AI space. The news led to shares of NVIDIA falling nearly 17% on Monday.\nEarnings season also continued to roll along, with companies representing approximately 40% of the S&P 500 Index’s market capitalization reporting results during the week, according to T. Rowe Price traders. Several positive earnings surprises and upbeat forward guidance, particularly from some notable large-cap tech companies (including Meta Platforms and Apple), appeared to be a tailwind for stocks late in the week and helped the major indexes recover some of their earlier losses.\nTariff risks continue to loom\nThe second week of the Trump administration also brought a slew of political headlines that appeared to influence sentiment, particularly regarding the administration’s plans for global tariffs. President Donald Trump reiterated his plan to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, the U.S.’s top two trading partners, by February 1, while also threatening to levy an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. This comes after the prior week’s comments from the president, which seemed to give investors hope that he would take a softer-than-anticipated stance on global tariffs.\nFed holds rates steady while core PCE inflation remains unchanged\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve concluded its first meeting of 2025 on Wednesday and announced it would be holding its policy rate range steady at 4.25% to 4.50%, as was widely expected. According to the Fed’s post-meeting statement, U.S. economic activity “has continued to expand at a solid pace,” while “labor market conditions remain solid” and inflation “remains somewhat elevated.” In a news conference following the meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell also stated that the Fed does “not need to be in a hurry to adjust” its policy stance and that it would need to see real progress on inflation or weakness in the labor market before making another rate cut, suggesting that the central bank will likely keep rates steady again at its next meeting.\nThe Commerce Department’s release of its core (less food and energy) personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index on Friday morning appeared to support the Fed’s comments regarding elevated inflation. According to the report, core PCE—which is the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation—rose 2.8% year over year in December for the third consecutive month since accelerating a tick from 2.7% in September. The Fed’s long-term core PCE target is 2%.\nIn other economic news, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday that the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.3% in the fourth quarter and 2.8% for the full year, modestly below consensus expectations but ahead of the Fed’s long-run forecasts of 1.8%. The report cited increases in consumer and government spending as the main drivers of growth during the fourth quarter.\nU.S. Treasury yields fall\nU.S. Treasuries generated positive returns, due in part to an ease in the initial angst surrounding the DeepSeek developments from Monday, according to T. Rowe Price traders. (Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.) The investment-grade corporate bond market had a quiet week with only three issuers coming to market on Tuesday, and new issues were oversubscribed.\nIndex\nFriday's Close\nWeek's Change\n% Change YTD\nDJIA\n44,544.66\n120.41\n4.70%\nS&P 500\n6,040.53\n-60.71\n2.70%\nNasdaq Composite\n19,627.44\n-326.86\n1.64%\nS&P MidCap 400\n3,239.04\n-36.60\n3.78%\nRussell 2000\n2,287.69\n-20.05\n2.58%\nThis chart is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the performance of any specific security.\nPast performance cannot guarantee future results.\nSource of data: Reuters, obtained through Yahoo!

Strong earnings results and the European Central Bank’s (ECB) decision to cut interest rates boosted investor sentiment. Germany’s DAX gained 1.58% and hit a new intraday peak during the week. Italy’s FTSE MIB added 0.75%, while France’s CAC 40 Index put on 0.28%. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index climbed 2.02%. The pound sterling depreciated against the U.S. dollar, helping to support the index, which includes many multinational companies with overseas revenues.\nECB cuts interest rates\nAs expected, the ECB reduced its key deposit rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.75%. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that the disinflation process was “well on track” and that the decision was unanimous. She also said that policy was still “restrictive,” adding that “we are not at the neutral rate.” Lagarde drew back from indicating how long the ECB might keep cutting rates, saying that “it would be premature at this point in time to talk about the point where we have to stop.”\nEurozone economy stalls; inflation slows in Germany, France\nRelative to the third quarter of 2024, the eurozone economy stalled in the final three months of last year, according to a first estimate that fell short of consensus expectations for a 0.1% expansion. However, the full-year growth rate of 0.7% was in line with the ECB’s forecast.\nThe bloc’s largest economies—Germany and France—contracted versus the third quarter. Italy's gross domestic product (GDP) was flat. Spain, on the other hand, experienced GDP growth, with its economy expanding 0.8%.\nThe European Union-harmonized 12-month inflation rate for January came in at 1.8% in France, stayed at 2.8% in Germany, and accelerated to 2.9% in Spain.\nSwedish central bank eases policy\nAs expected, the Riksbank lowered its key interest rate for the sixth time in its campaign to ease monetary policy, to 2.25% from 2.50%. Its guidance from December indicated that borrowing costs might be lowered only once more in the first half of the new year, suggesting a pause in rate cuts. The bank stated that the risk of inflation becoming high was limited and that economic activity was weak. However, the central bank added that it stood ready to act if the outlook for inflation and economic activity changes.\nUK mortgage market steady\nMortgage loan volumes in the UK were higher than expected in December, rising the most since September 2022, according to Bank of England data. Lenders approved 66,526 new mortgages for home purchases, up from 66,061 in November.\nReturn to Top\nJapan\nJapan’s stock markets registered mixed performance over the week. The Nikkei 225 Index fell 0.90% while the broader TOPIX Index gained 1.37%. A sell-off in major technology stocks early in the week on the emergence of Chinese company DeepSeek, a potential challenger to perceived U.S. artificial intelligence dominance, weighed on the share prices of Japanese chip companies.\nTighter monetary policy weighs on stocks\nDomestic stocks were also pressured by the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) hawkish stance (it raised interest rates for the third time within a year and revised its inflation forecasts upward at its January 23–24 monetary policy meeting). The central bank’s base case, reiterated by BoJ Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino during the week, is that it will raise rates if the economy and prices move in line with its forecasts. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said that the central bank’s message on gradual interest rate hikes has been clearly received by financial markets.\nOn expectations that the BoJ will continue gradually raising interest rates, the yen strengthened to the high end of the JPY 154 against the U.S. dollar range, from 156 at the end of the previous week. The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond was broadly unchanged from the prior week at 1.23%, remaining near a 14-year high.\nOn the economic data front, the Tokyo-area core consumer price index, a leading indicator of nationwide trends, rose 2.5% year on year in January, matching expectations and up from 2.4% in December. The reading reinforced a hawkish outlook for BoJ monetary policy. However, a relatively weak growth backdrop remains a downside risk and supports a gradual hiking pace.\nReturn to Top\nChina\nMainland Chinese stock markets edged lower in a holiday-shortened week. The onshore benchmark CSI 300 Index and the Shanghai Composite Index declined on Monday, the last day of trading before the Lunar New Year holiday. Markets on the mainland are closed from January 28 to February 4 for the nationwide holiday and will resume trading February 5. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index recorded slight gains on Monday and a half-day session on Tuesday before the market closed for the rest of the week.\nGovernment data released on Monday showed that China’s economy kicked off 2025 on weak footing. The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) unexpectedly fell to 49.1 in January, according to the country’s statistics bureau. The nonmanufacturing PMI—which measures construction and services activity—slipped to 50.2 from December’s 52.2. (Index readings above 50 indicate expansion, while those below 50 signal contraction.)\nChina’s manufacturing PMI is typically softer in January as millions of workers return to their hometowns for the Lunar New Year. However, other data released on Monday pointed to weakness in China’s economy at the end of 2024. Profits at large industrial companies fell 3.3% in 2024, according to the statistics bureau, marking the third straight year of declines. Economists believe the drop in industrial profits reflected the deflationary pressures on China’s economy, which is entering its third year of economy-wide price declines amid a yearslong real estate downturn that has curbed domestic demand.\nReturn to Top\nOther Key Markets\nHungary\nRates remain unchanged amid risks of a “higher inflation path” this year\nEarly in the week, the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) held its regularly scheduled meeting and kept its main policy rate, the base rate, at 6.50%. The NBH also held the overnight collateralized lending rate—the upper limit of an interest rate “corridor” for the base rate—at 7.50%. In addition, the central bank left the overnight deposit rate, which is the lower limit of that corridor, unchanged at 5.50%. No rate changes were expected at this time.\nAccording to the central bank’s post-meeting statement, policymakers identified the “weak outlook for European industrial production and the generally tense geopolitical situation” as factors posing “risks in terms of external economic activity.” They also noted that a possible “divergence between the monetary policies” of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank “could lead to increased risk aversion in emerging markets.”\nDomestically, policymakers claimed that the Hungarian economy “was subdued and had a strongly dual nature” in the fourth quarter, as indicated by retail sales growth and a decline in industrial production and construction activity. Also, while “subdued European economic activity” is hurting Hungarian exports in the short term, central bank officials expect “significant capacity-enhancing foreign direct investment projects” to stimulate exports starting in mid-2025.\nRegarding inflation, policymakers noted that consumer prices rose 4.6% year over year in December and that core inflation rose to 4.7%. They expect a temporary rise in inflation to continue in January, but they also believe that the “disinflationary trend will restart thereafter.” However, economic data suggest that there is “an increased risk of a higher inflation path this year,” and policymakers believe that the rate of consumer price increases will return to the central bank’s tolerance band later than they previously projected.\nUltimately, central bank officials decided to leave interest rates at current levels. They believe that “anchoring inflation expectations, preserving financial market stability,” and maintaining “a disciplined monetary policy are crucial for the consumer price index to return to the central bank target in a sustained manner.”\nBrazil\nPolicymakers raise Selic rate by 100 basis points, project a similar rate increase in March\nOn Wednesday, Brazil’s central bank decided to raise its key interest rate, the Selic rate, by 100 basis points, from 12.25% to 13.25%. The decision, which was widely expected, was unanimous among policymakers, and it was also Gabriel Galipolo’s first meeting as president of the central bank. Galipolo, formerly a director of Monetary Policy, succeeds former central bank President Roberto Campos Neto.\nAccording to T. Rowe Price sovereign analyst Richard Hall, policymakers provided forward guidance for another 100-basis-point rate increase at their next meeting in mid-March. This is consistent with their guidance following the policy meeting in December, when they projected 100-basis-point rate hikes at the next two policy meetings. However, Hall notes that policymakers have left their options open after the mid-March meeting, as their post-meeting statement repeats previously used language that the “total magnitude of the tightening cycle” will be whatever is needed for them to get inflation to converge to the central bank’s target.\nImportant Information\nThis material is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended to be investment advice or a recommendation to take any particular investment action.\nThe views are as of the date written and are subject to change without notice; these views may differ from those of other T. Rowe Price affiliated companies and/or associates.\nThis information is not intended to reflect a current or past recommendation concerning investments, investment strategies, or account types, advice of any kind, or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or investment services.

        "content": "Weekly Stock Market Update | Edward Jones\nUnited States | English\nCanada | English\nCanada | French\nWeekly market wrap\nPublished\tJan. 31, 2025\nPublished\tJanuary 31, 2025\nBrian Therien\nShare:\nShare on LinkedIn\nShare on Facebook\nBacked by a solid economy and healthy labor market, the Fed takes a pause\nKey Takeaways:\nThe U.S. economy remains on solid footing, growing at a 2.3% pace in the fourth quarter\nFour of the Magnificent 7 companies reported earnings this week, contributing to a strong corporate earnings season thus far\nThe Fed held interest rates steady this week, as expected, as core PCE remains above the 2% target and disinflation has slowed\nU.S. economy continues to grow at a solid pace\nFourth-quarter real GDP showed the U.S. economy remains on strong footing, growing 2.3% annualized, slightly below forecasts calling for 2.4%\n1\n. Consumer spending, representing about 68% of the economy, was the main driver of the expansion, rising at a 4.2% annualized rate, the highest reading since the first quarter of 2023\n1\n. Downturns in investment and exports were the primary detractors, contributing to the decline in real GDP growth from the prior quarter\n2\n. For the year, real GDP grew by 2.8% in 2024, down from 2.9% in 2023.\nIn our view, with the unemployment rate at 4.1% and job openings exceeding unemployment, a healthy labor market should keep wage gains above inflation, providing positive real wages. In addition, the U.S. manufacturing sector, which remained in contraction for much of the past two years, showed signs of stabilizing this month. We expect the healthy labor market and positive real wages to support consumer spending, which, combined with a potentially stabilizing manufacturing sector, should continue the economy's momentum this year.\nWhile growth could cool in the first half of the year as consumers, particularly those in lower income brackets, potentially pull back on discretionary spending, we don't expect a recession. We see the potential for growth to reaccelerate in the back half of the year, driven by Fed interest-rate cuts and pro-growth policies, such as deregulation and tax cuts.\nSource: FactSet.\nChart description\nThis chart shows quarterly real GDP growth since 2023 and estimates through 2025. SAAR is seasonally adjusted annual rate.\nSource: FactSet.\nThis chart shows quarterly real GDP growth since 2023 and estimates through 2025. SAAR is seasonally adjusted annual rate.\nEarnings season off to a solid start\nCorporate earnings ramped up this week, with four of the \"Magnificent 7\" companies reporting. Apple, Microsoft and Meta delivered strong results, above estimates for both earnings per share and revenue, while Tesla missed on both measures. Despite disappointing results, Tesla shares traded higher on optimism over the favorable regulatory environment, new more affordable models, and autonomous vehicles, including Robotaxi\n1\n.\nTechnology stocks are down this week but have rebounded from Monday's sharp sell-off that was sparked by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. The company's AI model reportedly performs comparably to those of leading U.S. technology companies, despite being developed at a fraction of the cost and requiring less computing power. While DeepSeek's development and true costs are still to be verified, it has raised questions as to whether leading U.S. AI companies may be overspending and need to be more efficient. Despite the concerns around the competition coming from Chinese companies like DeepSeek, we continue to see U.S. technology firms remaining leaders of the global AI market, benefiting from deep financial resources, talent and technology to drive innovation. We expect these companies to respond to this competitive threat, especially considering DeepSeek's AI model is open-source. This means the programming and coding behind its performance is transparent and openly available, potentially allowing competitors to incorporate any enhancements to improve their own AI models. Enhanced performance, lower development costs, and reduced computing-power demands should lead to further adoption of AI among businesses and consumers, potentially driving more investment in the space.\nFor the quarter, S&P 500 earnings are on track to grow roughly 12%, which, if achieved, would be the strongest pace since 2021. Earnings growth is expected to be broad as well, with seven of the 11 sectors forecast to report higher earnings. Strong earnings momentum is expected to carry over into 2025, with estimates calling for earnings growth of more than 14%\n1\n. In our view, healthy economic conditions and the potential for deregulation should drive strong earnings growth this year, helping sustain the bull market.\nBroadening earnings growth has contributed to a rotation in market leadership. Over the past six months, the financial and industrial sectors have each outperformed the technology sector\n1\n. Looking at more recent performance, the S&P 500 is off to a strong start this year, up about 3.9%, while the technology sector is down 1.1%\n1\n. We expect market performance to continue to widen beyond technology-focused stocks like the Magnificent 7.\nSource: FactSet.\nChart description\nThis chart shows S&P 500 earnings-per-share (EPS) growth since 2023 and estimates through 2025.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. An index is unmanaged, cannot be invested into directly and is not meant to depict an actual investment.\nFed holds rates steady\nThe Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its January meeting this week, maintaining its target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.5%. The Fed is taking a more patient approach toward easing monetary policy amid solid economic growth, a healthy labor market, slowing disinflation, and policy uncertainty. Core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge – has moderated to 2.8% from the 2022 peak of more than 5% but remains above the 2% target, and the pace of disinflation has slowed. With the fed funds rate currently around 4.35% and a neutral rate generally about 1% above inflation, monetary policy likely remains restrictive.\nThe shelter component of PCE remains elevated at 4.7% year-over-year\n1\nbut should continue to moderate as it catches up to other measures of housing prices that show slower gains. For example, the S&P Core Logic Case-Shiller Home Price index was up 3.8% through November over the year-earlier period\n3\n, while the Zillow Observed Rent Index rose 3.4% in 2024\n4\n. As inflation likely resumes its gradual trend lower, the Fed should be able to ease toward a more neutral stance, though at a slower pace, perhaps settling in the 3.5%-4.0% range this year.\nThe Fed made no change to its balance-sheet-reduction program, known as quantitative tightening (QT). While the timing is uncertain, quantitative tightening is expected to end sometime this year, which would serve to ease monetary policy. The Fed would also be able to participate in U.S. Treasury bond auctions more actively to replace maturing bonds. This additional demand should support bond prices, potentially helping to contain bond yields to the upside. Yields have pulled back from their January peak, with the 10-year Treasury yield down about 25 basis points (0.25%) as the yield curve has flattened. Lower interest rates should reduce borrowing costs for individuals and businesses, which is supportive of continued economic growth and corporate earnings.\nSource: FactSet.\nChart description\nThis chart shows the path of the fed funds rate, the year-over-year percentage change in core PCE inflation and the Fed's inflation target since 2022.\nSource: FactSet.\nThis chart shows the path of the fed funds rate, the year-over-year percentage change in core PCE inflation and the Fed's inflation target since 2022.\nWe expect the economic expansion to continue this year, supported by a healthy labor market, positive real wages, lower interest rates, and pro-growth policies. A resilient economy should lead to robust and broadening earnings growth, sustaining the bull market while expanding market performance beyond technology-focused stocks like the Magnificent 7. We see value in investments with more domestic exposure and potential for earnings growth and valuation expansion, strengthening the case for portfolio diversification.\nBrian Therien, CFA\nInvestment Strategy\nSources: 1.

On Monday, technology stocks pulled the broader market down amid news of a competitive threat that a Chinese startup company poses to U.S. tech companies’ AI initiatives.\n2025’s solid start\nThe major U.S. stock indexes recorded positive results in January, regaining upward momentum after the S&P 500 and the Dow posted negative results in the final month of 2024. In January, the Dow climbed more than 4%, the S&P 500 added nearly 3%, and the NASDAQ finished almost 2% higher.\nGDP moderation\nThe U.S. economy remained firmly in growth mode toward the end of 2024, although the fourth quarter’s GDP figure came in slightly below most economists’ expectations. GDP expanded at an annual rate of 2.3% in the period, capping a year in which the economy recorded a 2.8% full-year growth rate, slightly below 2023’s 2.9% figure.\nEarnings checkup\nEarnings continued to modestly exceed analysts’ expectations, remaining on track to record the fastest quarterly growth rate in three years. As of Friday, fourth-quarter net income was expected to rise 13.2% compared with the year-ago quarter, based on companies that have already reported plus projections for those that haven’t yet released results. Prior to earnings season, analysts had forecast an 11.8% growth rate.\nFed holds steady\nAs expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged as it wrapped up a two-day meeting on Wednesday. The next day, the European Central Bank approved a rate cut for its fifth policy meeting in a row.\nGold record\nThe price of gold rose more than 1% for the week, eclipsing the precious metal’s previous record high set three months earlier. On Friday, gold was trading above the $2,800-per-ounce level for the first time, with an afternoon price of around $2,830. Twelve months ago, gold was trading slightly above $2,000.\nSticky inflation\nInflation remains well above the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 2.0% long-term target, based on Friday’s reading from the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. PCE inflation rose at an annual rate of 2.6% in December, up from 2.4% the previous month. Excluding energy and food prices, the core PCE Index rose 2.8%, which was unchanged from the previous month.\nJobs ahead\nA monthly jobs report due out on Friday will show whether recently positive momentum for the labor market extended into January. The economy generated 212,000 new jobs in November and December’s figure grew to 256,000. In contrast, October’s jobs gain was relatively small at just 43,000.\nThe week ahead: February 3-7\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\nInstitute for Supply Management’s manufacturing

The NASDAQ Composite Index is a market-value-weighted index of all common stocks listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. The S&P 500 Index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. The MSCI Europe, Australasia, and Far East (EAFE) Index tracks the performance of publicly traded large- and mid-cap stocks of companies in those regions. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) shows the market’s expectation of 30-day volatility and is constructed using the implied volatilities of a wide range of S&P 500 Index options. Weekly and year-to-date figures for the VIX show percentage changes, not investment returns. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.\nThe Treasury yield curve is derived from available U.S. Treasury securities trading in the market and is provided directly by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The spread measures the difference in yield between two government securities. A normal (positive) yield curve occurs when longer-term rates are higher than shorter-term rates. The opposite holds true for an inverted yield curve.

We use our three-phase framework to track AI’s progress.\nMarket backdrop\nU.S. stocks were flat last week. Tech shares slid on AI concerns, only to reverse on solid Q4 earnings. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell near five-week lows.\nWeek ahead\nThis week we watch for any initial disruptions from the U.S. imposing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as a further 10% tariff on China.\nLast week’s volatility in AI-related stocks shows markets are learning in real time about the transformation underway. We see having a framework as key for tracking mega forces, or big structural shifts, given a widening range of market outcomes. We use our three-phase framework – buildout, adoption, transformation – to track AI. Recent AI developments raise questions about AI investment and revenue. We see a broadening set of AI beneficiaries and stay overweight U.S. stocks.\nDownload full commentary (PDF)\nMarket commentary\nAsset class views\nParagraph-2,Paragraph-3,Image-1,Paragraph-4\nParagraph-5,Advance Static Table-1,Paragraph-6,Advance Static Table-2,Paragraph-7,Advance Static Table-3,Paragraph-8,Advance Static Table-4\nInvestment surge\nCorporate investment vs. U.S. government R&D, 1960-2024\nIt is not possible to invest directly in an index. Indexes are unmanaged and performance does not account for fees.\nSource: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Bloomberg, February 2025. Note: The chart shows the investment in research and development from the U.S. government and corporate investment from the “magnificent seven” stocks: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.\nWe have said artificial intelligence could reshape economies and markets even as big questions remain about what exactly that will look like – in particular, who will generate the profits. We are in the AI buildout, with total capital investment by the “magnificent seven” mostly mega cap tech stocks on par with government R&D. See the chart. The release of a seemingly more efficient AI model by Chinese startup DeepSeek has renewed questions about AI capex. While these questions are valid, more spending is likely needed to unlock AI innovation – recent developments don’t change our view. Broad AI adoption is still to come, and we have barely scratched the surface of all the potential AI use cases. Yet AI advances mean these models could be evolving faster than expected. That could push AI into the adoption phase sooner and is why the AI narrative and the market’s reaction could change quickly.\nWe are still in AI’s buildout phase – and even with potential model efficiency gains, big capital spending might still be needed to unlock further innovation, like artificial general intelligence. Strong results and guidance from the magnificent seven show they can support heavy AI capex. Q4 management commentary reveals these companies are comfortable with their AI spend and have long-term conviction in the theme and expect ongoing demand. As the buildout progresses, it opens the door for the set of AI winners to broaden further beyond the magnificent seven, expanding the total AI opportunity set, in our view.\nEvolving our views\nBeyond the buildout phase, we have yet to see the adoption phase begin in earnest, even with more players in the mix. Yet the rise of new AI models signals we could move through AI’s phases quicker than anticipated, especially if efficiency gains from those models are indeed significant. Efficiency gains could ease earlier market fears that AI capacity won’t keep up with rising demand. The spread of simpler, cheaper AI models could spur wider adoption by companies that need greater transparency over AI's output. To gauge adoption, we track sectors with a high share of jobs prone to AI-driven efficiency gains. AI’s final phase may bring long-run, economy-wide productivity benefits – but only after AI tools have been built and broadly adopted.\nWe believe AI will generate significant revenue streams, yet how those revenues will be sliced up is the big question to track. One possible outcome: the big tech players now powering the AI buildout could reap most of the benefits. Yet last week’s developments show there is another path: cheap, efficient and commoditized AI models that could benefit AI’s end users instead of big tech. Across all three phases, following the revenue helps us to uncover investment opportunities.\nAI is at the center of the U.S.-China strategic competition. The U.S. strategy has been to protect and extend its AI lead, in part by denying China access to advanced tech and hardware. DeepSeek’s apparent breakthrough has raised questions for some about the effectiveness of this approach. The new administration has emphasized AI leadership is key for U.S. economic and national security. We expect a continued focus on export controls, data security and concentrating the AI buildout in the U.S.\nOur bottom line\nWe keep our broad U.S. equity overweight. The emergence of new AI models shows the AI transformation could be accelerating, in our view. Across AI’s three phases, we track revenue generation for identifying AI investment opportunities.\nMarket backdrop\nU.S. stocks were flat last week. Tech shares slid, led by Nvidia, on concerns about whether the AI buildout was overdone – only to reverse on solid Q4 mega cap tech earnings, leaving the Nasdaq little changed on the week. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell to around 4.51%, near five-week lows. The Federal Reserve opted to hold rates steady at last week’s policy meeting, while the European Central Bank cut rates 25 basis points – both moves widely expected.\nMarkets will focus on any disruptions resulting from the U.S. imposing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico (10% for Canadian oil), and an extra 10% tariff on Chinese goods, all due to be implemented this week. This marks an escalation in trade protectionism, and we think that some level of tariffs is likely to remain in place over time. Uncertainty is high on how the trade dispute will play out on supply chains, growth and inflation. U.S. payrolls are also due this week.\nWeek ahead\nSource\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results. Indexes are unmanaged and do not account for fees.

We tap into beneficiaries outside the tech sector. Robust economic growth, broad earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin our conviction and overweight in U.S. stocks versus other regions. We see valuations for big tech backed by strong earnings, and less lofty valuations for other sectors.\nJapanese equities\nA brighter outlook for Japan’s economy and corporate reforms are driving improved earnings and shareholder returns. Yet the potential drag on earnings from a stronger yen is a risk.\nSelective in fixed income\nPersistent deficits and sticky inflation in the U.S. make us more positive on fixed income elsewhere, notably Europe. We are underweight long-term U.S. Treasuries and like UK gilts instead. We also prefer European credit – both investment grade and high yield – over the U.S. on cheaper valuations.\nStrategic\nInfrastructure equity and private credit\nWe see opportunities in infrastructure equity due to attractive relative valuations and mega forces. We think private credit will earn lending share as banks retreat – and at attractive returns.\nFixed income granularity\nWe prefer short- and medium-term investment grade credit, which offers similar yields with less interest rate risk than long-dated credit. We also like short-term government bonds in the U.S. and euro area and UK gilts overall.\nEquity granularity\nWe favor emerging over developed markets yet get selective in both. EMs at the cross current of mega forces – like India and Saudi Arabia – offer opportunities. In DM, we like Japan as the return of inflation and corporate reforms brighten the outlook.\nSource\nNote: Views are from a U.S. dollar perspective, February 2025.

This information should not be relied upon by the reader as research or investment advice regarding any particular funds, strategy or security.\nTactical granular views\nSix to 12-month tactical views on selected assets vs. broad global asset classes by level of conviction,\nFebruary 2025\nOur approach is to first determine asset allocations based on our macro outlook – and what’s in the price. The table below reflects this. It leaves aside the opportunity for alpha, or the potential to generate above-benchmark returns. The new regime is not conducive to static exposures to broad asset classes, in our view, but it is creating more space for alpha. For example, the alpha opportunity in highly efficient DM equities markets historically has been low. That’s no longer the case, we think, thanks to greater volatility, macro uncertainty and dispersion of returns. The new regime puts a premium on insights and skill, in our view.\nSearch views\nAsset\nTactical view\nCommentary\nEquities\nUnited States\nWe are overweight as the AI theme and earnings growth broaden. Valuations for AI beneficiaries are supported by tech companies delivering on earnings. Resilient growth and Fed rate cuts support sentiment. Risks include any long-term yield surges or escalating trade protectionism.\nEurope\nWe are underweight. Valuations are fair. A growth pickup and European Central Bank rate cuts support a modest earnings recovery. Yet political uncertainty could keep investors cautious.\nU.K.\nWe are neutral. Political stability could improve investor sentiment. Yet an increase in the corporate tax burden could hurt profit margins near term.\nJapan\nWe are overweight. A brighter outlook for Japan’s economy and corporate reforms are driving improved earnings and shareholder returns. Yet a stronger yen dragging on earnings is a risk.\nEmerging markets\nWe are neutral. The growth and earnings outlook is mixed. We see valuations for India and Taiwan looking high.\nChina\nWe are modestly overweight. China’s fiscal stimulus is not yet enough to address the drags on economic growth, but we think stocks are at attractive valuations to DM shares. We stand ready to pivot. We are cautious long term given China’s structural challenges.\nFixed income\nShort U.S. Treasuries\nWe are neutral. Markets are pricing in fewer Federal Reserve rate cuts and their policy rate expectations are now roughly in line with our views.\nLong U.S. Treasuries\nWe are underweight. Persistent budget deficits and geopolitical fragmentation could drive term premium up over the near term. We prefer intermediate maturities less vulnerable to investors demanding more term premium.\nGlobal inflation-linked bonds\nWe are neutral. We see higher medium-term inflation, but cooling inflation and growth may matter more near term.\nEuro area government bonds\nWe are neutral. Market pricing reflects policy rates in line with our expectations and 10-year yields are off their highs. Political uncertainty remains a risk to fiscal sustainability.\nUK Gilts\nWe are overweight. Gilt yields offer attractive income, and we think the Bank of England will cut rates more than the market is pricing given a soft economy. But we are monitoring any government response to the recent fiscal concerns.\nJapan government bonds\nWe are underweight. Stock returns look more attractive to us. We see some of the least attractive returns in JGBs.\nChina government bonds\nWe are neutral. Bonds are supported by looser policy. Yet we find yields more attractive in short-term DM paper.\nU.S. agency MBS\nWe are neutral. We see agency MBS as a high-quality exposure in a diversified bond allocation and prefer it to IG.\nShort-term IG credit\nWe are overweight. Short-term bonds better compensate for interest rate risk.\nLong-term IG credit\nWe are underweight. Spreads are tight, so we prefer taking risk in equities from a whole portfolio perspective. We prefer Europe over the U.S.\nGlobal high yield\nWe are neutral. Spreads are tight, but the total income makes it more attractive than IG. We prefer Europe.\nAsia credit\nWe are neutral. We don’t find valuations compelling enough to turn more positive.\nEmerging market - hard currency\nWe are neutral. The asset class has performed well due to its quality, attractive yields and EM central bank rate cuts. We think those rate cuts may soon be paused.\nEmerging market - local currency\nWe are neutral. Yields have fallen closer to U.S. Treasury yields, and EM central banks look to be turning more cautious after cutting policy rates sharply.\nSource\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results.

Valuations are fair. A growth pickup and European Central Bank rate cuts support a modest earnings recovery. Yet geopolitical tensions, domestic political uncertainty, potential tariffs, and fading optimism about China’s stimulus could weigh on investor sentiment.\nGermany\nWe are underweight. Valuations and earnings momentum offer modest support compared to peers, especially as ECB rate cuts ease financing conditions. Prolonged uncertainty over the next government, potential tariffs, and fading optimism about China’s stimulus could dampen sentiment.\nFrance\nWe are underweight. The outcome of France’s parliamentary election and ongoing political uncertainty could weigh on business conditions for French companies. Yet, only a small share of the revenues and operations of major French firms is tied to domestic activity.\nItaly\nWe are underweight. Valuations are supportive relative to peers, but past growth and earnings outperformance largely stemmed from significant fiscal stimulus in 2022-2023, which is unlikely to be sustained in the coming years.\nSpain\nWe are neutral. Valuations and earnings momentum are supportive compared to other euro area stocks. The utilities sector stands to gain from an improving economic backdrop and advancements in AI.\nNetherlands\nWe are underweight. The Dutch stock market’s tilt to technology and semiconductors—key beneficiaries of rising AI demand—is offset by less favorable valuations and a weaker earnings outlook compared to European peers.\nSwitzerland\nWe are underweight, consistent with our broader European view. Earnings have improved, but valuations remain elevated compared to other European markets. The index’s defensive tilt may offer less support if global risk appetite stays strong.\nUK\nWe are neutral. Political stability could improve investor sentiment. Yet an increase in the corporate tax burden could hurt profit margins near term.\nFixed income\nEuro area government bonds\nWe are neutral. Market pricing aligns with our policy rate expectations, and 10-year yields have retreated from their highs. Political uncertainty poses risks to fiscal sustainability, but select peripheral markets are bolstered by stronger growth and improving credit ratings.\nGerman bunds\nWe are neutral. Market pricing aligns with our policy rate expectations, and 10-year yields have eased from their highs, partly due to growth concerns. We are watching the fiscal flexibility debate ahead of upcoming elections.\nFrench OATs\nWe are neutral. France faces challenges from elevated political uncertainty, persistent budget deficits, and a slower pace of structural reforms. The EU has already warned the country for breaching fiscal rules, and its sovereign credit rating was downgraded earlier this year.\nItalian BTPs\nWe are neutral. The spread over German bunds looks tight given its budget deficits and debt profile, prompting a warning from the EU. Other domestic factors remain supportive, with growth holding up relative to the rest of the euro area and Italian households showing solid demand to hold BTPs at higher yields.\nUK gilts\nWe are overweight. Gilt yields offer attractive income, and we think the Bank of England will cut rates more than the market is pricing given a soft economy. But we are monitoring any government response to the recent fiscal concerns.\nSwiss government bonds\nWe are neutral. The Swiss National Bank has cut policy rates this year as inflationary pressures eased but is unlikely to reduce rates significantly further.\nEuropean inflation-linked bonds\nWe are neutral. We see higher medium-term inflation, but cooling inflation and sluggish growth may matter more near term.\nEuropean investment grade credit\nWe are neutral on European investment grade credit, favoring short- to medium-term paper for quality income. We prefer European investment grade over the US, as spreads are relatively wider.\nEuropean high yield\nWe are overweight. The income potential is attractive, and we prefer European high yield for its more appealing valuations, higher quality, and shorter duration compared to the US. In our view, spreads adequately compensate for the risk of a potential rise in defaults.\nSource\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results.\nIt is not possible to invest directly in an index.
