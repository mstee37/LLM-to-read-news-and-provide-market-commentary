Rowe Price\nHome\nResources\nInsights\nGlobal markets weekly update\nmarkets & economy\n|  February 14, 2025\nGlobal markets weekly update\nU.S. inflation accelerates in January\nHighlighted Regions\nU.S.\nEurope\nJapan\nChina\nOther Key Markets\nU.S.\nStock indexes climb toward record highs\nU.S. stocks finished mostly higher with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way, gaining 2.58% during the week. As measured by Russell indexes, growth stocks outperformed value shares for the second week this year. Small-cap stocks lagged, with the Russell 2000 Index trailing the S&P 500 Index by 146 basis points (1.46 percentage points) for the week. The S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite both closed the week within 1% of all-time highs.\nStocks had their best day of the week on Thursday, largely in response to President Donald Trump’s decision to not introduce new global tariffs, instead signing an order that—following further study—could lead to the implementation of reciprocal tariffs on a country-by-country basis by April 1. While the news left some uncertainty, investors appeared to be encouraged as the move will further delay the implementation of additional tariffs and seemingly allow room for negotiation between the U.S. and its individual trade partners.\nJanuary inflation data fuel higher-for-longer rate expectations\nThe week’s economic calendar was highlighted by Wednesday’s inflation data, which came in higher than expected. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the headline consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.5% month over month and 3.0% year over year in January, accelerating from December’s readings of 0.4% and 2.9%, respectively. Shelter costs rose 0.4% and accounted for nearly 30% of the total increase during the month. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4% in January, up from December’s reading of 0.2%.\nThursday brought more inflation data in the form of the BLS’s producer price index (PPI), which similarly rose more than expected, advancing 0.4% in January compared with consensus expectations for a 0.3% increase. However, certain closely watched components of the index—including health care items and airfares—showed signs of cooling, which seemed to help ease some concerns following Wednesday’s CPI report.\nWhile testifying in front of the Senate Banking Committee, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that the hotter-than-expected inflation data show that while Fed policymakers have made significant progress on bringing down inflation, they are “not quite there yet” and they “want to keep policy restrictive for now.” Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee echoed Powell’s sentiment in an interview with The New York Times during the week, calling the inflation figures “sobering” and adding “if we got multiple months like this, then the job is clearly not done.” Futures market expectations for the next rate cut moved from September to December following the CPI print.\nTreasury yields volatile after hotter-than-expected inflation readings\nU.S. Treasuries were somewhat volatile as yields rose in response to the week’s inflation data, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield touching an intraday high of 4.66% following Wednesday’s CPI report, before decreasing later in the week. (Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.) Municipal bonds underperformed U.S. Treasuries in the wake of the CPI print, although Thursday saw a partial rebound in the muni market.\nMeanwhile, investment-grade corporate bonds outperformed Treasuries. Issuance was light and saw strong demand, although only two deals were oversubscribed. T. Rowe Price traders noted that higher yields and lower supply continued to result in secondary buying. Our traders also noted that the high yield bond market remained resilient overall amid the move higher in equities and volatile Treasury yields.\nIndex\nFriday's Close\nWeek's Change\n% Change YTD\nDJIA\n44,546.08\n242.68\n4.71%\nS&P 500\n6,114.63\n88.64\n3.96%\nNasdaq Composite\n20,026.77\n503.37\n3.71%\nS&P MidCap 400\n3,198.61\n-7.99\n2.49%\nRussell 2000\n2,279.98\n0.27\n2.23%\nThis chart is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the performance of any specific security.\nPast performance cannot guarantee future results.\nSource of data: Reuters, obtained through Yahoo!

Hopes of an end to the Ukraine-Russia conflict and robust earnings reports buoyed sentiment. Major stock indexes rose as well. Germany’s DAX climbed 3.33%, France’s CAC 40 gained 2.58%, and Italy’s FTSE MIB put on 2.49%. The UK’s FTSE 100 added 0.37%.\nUK unexpectedly returns to growth; BoE’s Pill calls for caution on rate cuts\nBritain's economy unexpectedly grew by 0.1% in the final quarter of last year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast gross domestic product (GDP) would shrink by 0.1%, but growth of 0.4% in December lifted the quarter. The ONS said growth in services and construction was partly offset by a drop in production. GDP grew 0.9% in 2024, up from 0.3% in 2023.\nBank of England (BoE) Chief Economist Huw Pill told a business group that policymakers must still be cautious about cutting interest rates because of continuing strong pay growth. In an interview with Reuters, he added that more work had to be done to bring down inflation, \"and that means we can't just remove all restriction overnight, cut rates aggressively, etc.\" Fellow Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Catherine Mann, previously one of the most hawkish members of the MPC, argued that the BoE should have cut rates by half a percentage point at its last meeting instead of a quarter point because a weakening labor market and slowing consumer demand were helping to subdue inflation.\nEurozone industry output falls faster than forecast; fourth-quarter growth revised up\nEurozone industrial production in December shrank 1.1% sequentially due to sharp declines in capital goods and intermediate goods output. The consensus forecast of analysts surveyed by FactSet was for a contraction of 0.5%. Year over year, production was 2.0% lower, dragged down by an 8.0% fall in the production of capital goods.\nMeanwhile, the eurozone economy expanded at a quarterly 0.1% pace in the final three months of last year instead of stagnating, according to a second estimate (which includes more countries) produced by the European statistics agency. Annual growth was 0.7% for the full year.\nReturn to Top\nJapan\nJapan’s stock markets rose over the week, with the Nikkei 225 Index gaining 0.93% and the broader TOPIX Index up 0.80%. The weakness of the yen provided a favorable backdrop, and sentiment was further boosted by U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to refrain from immediately imposing reciprocal tariffs on its trading partners. Japanese authorities said that they would assess the detail and impact of any potential U.S. reciprocal tariffs and respond appropriately.\nPace of interest rate hikes remains uncertain\nWhile the current consensus view appears to be that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is next likely to raise rates in the second half of this year, Japanese government bond (JGB) yields trended upward as a growing number of investors converged around the view that the pace of interest rate hikes by the BoJ could be faster than expected. The yield on the 10-year JGB rose to 1.35% from 1.28% at the end of the previous week, reaching its highest level in almost 15 years.\nHot inflation print supports case for further monetary policy\nThe latest corporate goods price index (CGPI) print, a measure of input prices for Japanese firms, lent support to the case for further monetary policy normalization by the BoJ. The CGPI rose 4.2% year on year in January, higher than consensus expectations of a 4.0% increase and up from the prior month’s 3.9%. January’s gain was driven by growth in the price of agricultural products such as rice.\nSoaring prices prompt government to release rice from its reserves\nIn a first for Japan’s government, it announced that it would release rice from its reserves explicitly to counter soaring prices (rather than due to an emergency situation), with inventories to be distributed to wholesalers in March. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said during the week that there are risks that food prices will continue to be high and affect people’s inflation expectations and that the central bank will bear this in mind in its conduct of monetary policy.\nReturn to Top\nChina\nMainland Chinese stock markets rose, lifted by hopes that U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports may prove to be milder than expected following the Trump administration’s decision to impose a 10% tariff on the country’s products in early February. The onshore benchmark CSI 300 Index added 1.19% and the Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.30% in local currency terms, according to FactSet. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index surged 7.04%, driven by strength in tech shares as investors bought up artificial intelligence names.\nOn the economics front, China’s consumer price index rose a higher-than-expected 0.5% in January from a year ago, accelerating from December’s 0.1% rise, according to the country’s statistics bureau. January’s increase marked the first pickup in consumer inflation since August and was likely driven by a spending surge ahead of the eight-day Lunar New Year holiday. However, the producer price index fell 2.3% in January, unchanged from December’s reading and marking the 28th consecutive month of factory deflation. Stamping out deflation is a matter of growing urgency for Beijing, which unleashed a slew of monetary and fiscal stimulus last September to bolster demand. But a yearslong housing slump has prompted people to save rather than spend, frustrating officials’ attempts to boost consumer spending.\nIn corporate news, Moody’s lowered its credit rating for troubled real estate company China Vanke for the second time this year, deeper into junk territory, citing its weakening financial performance. Moody’s latest action raised the possibility of default for Vanke, a state-backed developer that was once considered too big to fail. China’s government is working on a plan to help Vanke plug a funding gap of about USD 6.8 billion this year, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing unnamed officials. Despite falling short of a full bailout, the reported plan suggested that the government would not allow Vanke to suffer the same fate as China Evergrande, whose 2021 default and subsequent liquidation flagged the severity of the country’s housing downturn.\nReturn to Top\nOther Key Markets\nPhilippines\nPolicymakers hold rates steady amid “uncertainty over global economic policies”\nAt its regularly scheduled meeting on Thursday, the central bank of the Philippines decided to leave its main policy rate, the target reverse repurchase rate, at 5.75%. The decision was somewhat surprising, as some had expected policymakers on the Monetary Board to reduce rates.\nAccording to the post-meeting statement, policymakers indicated that the most recent inflation forecasts “are not materially different” from their December projections. Also, they felt that the risks to the inflation outlook “have become broadly balanced for 2025 and 2026.” However, they also felt that, despite “firm” domestic growth prospects, “uncertainty over global economic policies” and their impact on the Philippines’ economy “has increased significantly.” As a result, central bank officials decided to pause their “measured shift to less restrictive monetary policy” while waiting for “further assessments” of the possible impact of global policy uncertainty and the potential effects of the actual policies.\nHungary\nNear-term rate cuts unlikely following hawkish inflation data\nEarlier in the week, the Hungarian government reported that the consumer price index for January increased 1.5% month over month. This was well above expectations for a 0.9% increase. Also, the year-over-year calculation for CPI inflation was 5.5% versus expectations for a 4.8% reading.\nAccording to T. Rowe Price credit analyst Ivan Morozov, food costs accounted for a large part of this big upside surprise, but there was also a considerable increase in services costs. For example, Morozov notes that telecom services costs increased 10% month over month in January—an adjustment that usually takes place in March. With the increase in services costs likely to add to inflation readings for the next few months, Morozov believes that these unequivocally hawkish inflation data drastically reduce the likelihood of monetary easing in the near future.\nImportant Information\nThis material is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended to be investment advice or a recommendation to take any particular investment action.\nThe views are as of the date written and are subject to change without notice; these views may differ from those of other T. Rowe Price affiliated companies and/or associates.\nThis information is not intended to reflect a current or past recommendation concerning investments, investment strategies, or account types, advice of any kind, or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or investment services.

        "content": "Weekly Stock Market Update | Edward Jones\nUnited States | English\nCanada | English\nCanada | French\nWeekly market wrap\nPublished\tFeb. 14, 2025\nPublished\tFebruary 14, 2025\nAngelo Kourkafas\nShare:\nShare on LinkedIn\nShare on Facebook\nMarket Crosscurrents: Headlines vs. What's Unfolding\nKey Takeaways:\nJanuary's CPI came in hotter than expected, driven by broad increases, some of which may not be repeated next month. Core inflation has been stuck around 3.3% for the past eight months and could stay rangebound this year. However, we do not see a return to the above-4% inflation experienced in the post-pandemic period.\nWith price pressures persistent and the labor market solid, the Fed is in no rush to cut rates. We still believe that the bank's next move will be a cut, but the timing is likely pushed back to the second half of the year.\nA leadership rotation is underway, challenging tech's dominant position. Earnings growth for the S&P 493 (S&P 500 minus the Magnificent 7) is accelerating after a two-year lull.\nCounter to headlines amid trade uncertainty, European equity markets are outperforming so far in 2025. We recommend investors use pullbacks to add to cyclical, value-style, and international investments if they are underrepresented in portfolios. We would also view any rise in the 10-year Treasury yield above 4.5% as an opportunity to extend duration of portfolios and lock in attractive yields\nWe’re two months into the year, and markets are navigating conflicting forces, where headlines, sentiment, and what's unfolding often diverge. Inflation has come a long way since its post-pandemic surge but remains stubborn, keeping the Fed in a delicate balancing act as tariff risks loom. Meanwhile, corporations are posting strong earnings despite global uncertainty, and European markets - frequently overlooked - are quietly gaining strength.\nThe common thread amid policy shifts and uncertainties is solid fundamentals, which continue to provide a strong foundation for market resilience. We offer our perspective on the key crosscurrents shaping the investment landscape and highlight how market trends in some cases run counter to headlines.\nInflation\nHeadlines: Prices climb in January, threatening the return of high inflation\nThe January consumer price index (CPI) came in hotter than expected, rising 0.5% from the prior month and 3% from a year ago, the strongest annual change since June. Both food and energy were meaningful contributors, with food prices rising at the fastest monthly pace in two years, as egg prices jumped 15% due to avian flu\n1\n.\nBut the acceleration in prices was not limited to these items. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, ticked higher to 3.3% from 3.2%, driven by an increase in prices for both goods and services. Some of the usual suspects included used vehicle prices (+2.2% from the prior month), car insurance (+2%), lodging (+1.4%) and airfare (+1.2%). This upside surprise comes on the heels of a jump in consumer inflation expectations to its highest since November 2023, as recorded by the University of Michigan survey\n1\n. And that's before any broad tariffs are implemented, which may have an impact on goods inflation, depending on how trade policy plays out.\nWhat's Unfolding: Inflation progress is stalling out instead of reversing in a major way. However, consumers feel the strain of the cumulative price increases.\nThe uptick in inflation should not be dismissed, but one month's data does not make a trend. The boost in energy prices probably won't be repeated in February, as oil prices have averaged $72 so far this month after a brief spike to $80 in January\n1\n. Disruption in the food supply chain is possibly another \"one-off\" increase. And like last year, the price increases that many companies implement in January may not have been adequately captured by the seasonal factors.\nNonetheless, core inflation has been stuck around 3.3% for the past eight months, certainly higher than the Fed would like it to be. Offering a glimmer of hope is that rent inflation rose modestly last month. And several of the components of the producer price index that feed into the Fed’s preferred inflation (the personal consumption expenditures price index, which will be released on February 28) improved\n1\n.\nWe do not expect a major second wave of inflation this year, but price increases could stay rangebound above the Fed's target. Importantly, we do not see a return to the above-4% inflation figures that we experienced in the post-pandemic period.\nHowever, consumers pay as much or more attention to the price tags rather than the rate of change. To this end, prices are about 13% higher compared with where they would have been had inflation grown at a 2% rate since 2021\n1\n. This dynamic explains the difference between what consumers hear in the headlines vs. how they feel about inflation. The slowdown in January retail sales possibly reflects some consumer fatigue in addition to other factors, like the snowstorms and California wildfires, that may have been at play.\nSource: Bloomberg, Edward Jones.\nChart description\nThe graph shows that on one hand inflation which represents the rate of price increases has made a lot of progress, but on the other hand the cumulative effect has led to the high prices that consumers are noticing.\nSource: Bloomberg, Edward Jones.\nThe graph shows that on one hand inflation which represents the rate of price increases has made a lot of progress, but on the other hand the cumulative effect has led to the high prices that consumers are noticing.\nFed\nHeadlines: Fed is in no rush to cut rates, and hikes may be back in the conversation\nAt his semiannual testimony to the U.S. Senate, Committee Chair Powell reiterated that the Fed can be patient in cutting interest rates and that there is more work to do on inflation. That point became even more relevant after the disappointing CPI, which likely closed the door on a March rate cut. Bond-market pricing suggests that the next rate cut is now expected in October, with a small chance that the Fed might resume rate hikes in 2026\n1\n.\nWhat's Unfolding: Fed is comfortable keeping policy unchanged, but rate hikes are unlikely\nWhile expressing no urgency to cut rates, Powell reiterated the Fed's view that policy is currently restrictive. To us, this implies that even if inflation proves persistent, policymakers can stay on pause for a prolonged time to get the desired inflation outcome rather than having to hike rates again.\nTrade uncertainty is a known unknown, and tariffs may have a short-term impact, but the Fed may not view any one-time step-up in prices as an ongoing source of inflation. Last week President Trump introduced a plan for reciprocal tariffs that will be released on April 1. That would apply to nations that have a higher average tariff rate than the U.S., which would raise its own tariff to match them to equalize barriers to trade. It remains to be seen what will actually go into effect, but the time until it is implemented leaves a window for negotiations. One thing that seems certain is that news on trade will stay front and center this year, which is why it is important for investors not to overact to each single headline. For more of our views on tariffs, please see our report \"\nUnpacking the potential impact of tariffs.\n\"\nStock-market leadership\nHeadlines: Magnificent 7 stocks had their worst earnings season since 2022\nThe Magnificent 7 group of companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, NVIDIA, and Tesla) that comprise about a third of the S&P 500 weight has lost some of its luster so far this year. Even though the group has contributed more than half of the S&P 500 gain in the past two years, performance is lagging in 2025, while sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 was at its slowest since 20222. Increasing competition in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena and rising spending are raising concerns about valuations, which carry a 35% premium to the broader index\n2\n.\nWhat's Unfolding: A leadership rotation is underway, as growth improves for the rest of the market\nProfits for the Magnificent 7 are indeed slowing after two years of explosive growth. Yet, results remain strong. Earnings for the group rose 25% in the fourth quarter, still outpacing the S&P 500, but to a lesser extent than in the recent past\n2\n. Up until last week, tech was the only sector down for the year, a stark difference to its dominant position over the past two years. On a positive note, that hasn't been enough to drag the whole market lower. We see the broadening of market leadership as a healthy development for the sustainability of the bull market in stocks.\nThe bigger story, in our view, is that earnings growth for the S&P 493 (subtracting the Magnificent 7) is accelerating after a two-year lull. For the fourth quarter, financials, health care, and real estate are joining the sectors that house the growth stocks (tech, communication services and consumer discretionary) in delivering double-digit profit growth. And the broader index is on track for its highest quarterly earnings increase in three years, with profits growing 17% from a year ago compared with expectations of 12% growth before earnings season started\n2\n.\nSource: FactSet, Edward Jones.\nChart description\nThe graph shows quarterly profit growth for the Magnificent 7 relative to the S&P 500.

The gap between the two has started to close. Past performance does not guarantee future results. An index is unmanaged, cannot be invested into directly and is not meant to depict an actual investment.\nInternational exposure\nHeadlines: Euro-area equities are perennial underperformers\nThe outlook for the euro-area stocks has been challenged by several years of anemic growth, low productivity, and, more recently, trade uncertainties. Germany, which accounts for 30% of eurozone GDP, has been particularly hurt by the slump in manufacturing. More broadly, international stocks have lagged U.S. stocks in eight of the past 10 years, with 2024 marking the largest underperformance since 1998\n1\n.\nWhat's Unfolding: Major indexes are reaching fresh highs\nWe are hesitant to make the case that the year-to-date rally in European stocks is the start of a new trend, but the vast divergence between the negative narrative in the headlines and positive price action is raising our antennas. The German DAX is up 13% so far this year, and the broader Stoxx 600, a proxy for European large-cap stocks, is up 10%, both outperforming the S&P 500\n2\n.\nStronger trends in consumer spending and corporate profits suggest that U.S. equities might maintain a leading position in 2025. But there are some potential positive catalysts that, if realized, may brighten the outlook for Europe. A push for a peace agreement to end the Russia-Ukraine war would lower energy prices. Also, the upcoming election this month in Germany may result in looser fiscal policies.\nWe believe that investors should maintain a strategic allocation in international stocks, as they play an important role in diversifying portfolios, especially when considering the heavily discounted valuations and attractive dividend yields relative to U.S. equities.\nSource: Bloomberg, Edward Jones.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. An index is unmanaged, cannot be invested into directly and is not meant to depict an actual investment.\nPortfolio considerations\nWhile stocks have been moving sideways for the past three months, as they've had to absorb news about increasing AI competition, tariffs, and a hotter-than-expected CPI, they remain well supported by positive fundamentals. Headline volatility will always be present, especially this year, but investors will be served well by separating the signal from the noise.\nUnder the hood, leadership is shifting, which is a positive development for diversified portfolios that stand to benefit from sector, style and geographic rotations. We recommend investors use pullbacks to add to cyclical, value-style, mid-cap, and international investments if they are underrepresented in portfolios. We would also view any rise in the 10-year Treasury yield above 4.5% as an opportunity to extend duration of portfolios and lock in attractive yields.\nAngelo Kourkafas, CFA\nInvestment Strategist\nSources: 1.

The S&P 500 finished just four points shy of a record high that it set three weeks earlier; the NASDAQ and the Dow were around a percentage point below their all-time peaks.\nSticky inflation\nWednesday’s Consumer Price Index report extended a recent trend of slightly hotter-than-expected inflation. Core inflation, excluding volatile energy and food prices, rose at an annual rate of 3.3% in January. That result was above economists’ consensus forecast and slightly above the previous month’s annual figure.\nShopping slowdown\nU.S. consumers trimmed their spending more than expected after the holiday shopping season. In January, retail sales fell 0.9% on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with the previous month. The result was well below most economists’ expectations and marked the biggest monthly decline in a year.\nEuropean equity comeback\nAfter lagging the U.S. equity market in 2024 and for much of the past decade, European stocks have outperformed their U.S. peers so far in 2025. A European index was up more than 12% year to date at Friday’s close, while the S&P 500 was up around 4%.\nPrecious metals rally\nThe price of gold climbed to a record high in a day of volatile metals trading on Friday,  reaching as high as $2,964 before retreating in afternoon trading. Silver also rallied and then stalled, briefly reaching the $34-per-ounce level and approaching the highest price in more than a decade.\nEarnings momentum\nWith earnings season nearing an end, profits continued to exceed expectations. As of Friday, analystys expected fourth-quarter net income to rise 16.9% compared with the same quarter a year earlier, based on the three-quarters of S&P 500 companies that had reported results and forecasts for companies that hadn't yet posted results. Before earnings season, analysts had expected growth of 11.8%.\nFed’s rate wait\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony that Fed policymakers need to see more progress in curbing inflation before considering further interest-rate cuts. Powell declined to specify the inflation rate that might trigger the Fed to approve a further cut in its benchmark rate, which has remained in a range of 4.25% to 4.50% since the last cut in December.\nU.K. GDP surprise\nThe United Kingdom’s economy eked out a 0.1% GDP growth rate at the end of 2024, exceeding economists’ expectations after stagnating in the previous quarter with a 0.0% reading. Thursday’s report on fourth-quarter GDP came a week after the Bank of England cut its benchmark interest rate.\nThe week ahead: February

We stay risk on and keep our U.S. equity overweight.\nMarket backdrop\nU.S. stocks were flat last week. Stocks recovered from the tariff-driven volatility thanks to solid Q4 corporate earnings, led by tech. U.S. bond yields dipped.\nWeek ahead\nThe January U.S. CPI is due this week. Wage growth remains above the level that would allow inflation to fall back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, we think.\nU.S. policy shifts and AI advances have driven sharp market volatility so far this year. This volatility underscores the fact we are in a new macro environment, with a wider range of outcomes possible. We stick to our core risk-on framework yet fine-tune our views. We stay overweight U.S. equities on a solid macro outlook and the AI mega force – a big, structural shift. We go overweight government bonds in the euro area, where the potential growth hit from tariffs should reinforce rate cuts.\nDownload full commentary (PDF)\nMarket commentary\nAsset class views\nParagraph-2,Paragraph-3,Image-1,Paragraph-4\nParagraph-5,Advance Static Table-1,Paragraph-6,Advance Static Table-2,Paragraph-7,Advance Static Table-3,Paragraph-8,Advance Static Table-4\nA potentially historic shift\nU.S. effective tariff rate, actual and potential, 1930-2025\nForward looking estimates may not come to pass.\nSource: BlackRock Investment Institute, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, with data from Haver Analytics, February 2025. Note: The chart shows the effective rate of tariffs on U.S. imports. The yellow dot shows our estimate of the effective tariff rate if the U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all imports. The pink dot estimate adds the impact of a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, on top of a blanket 10% tariff on all imports.\nWe entered 2025 expecting the unexpected and for policy to add volatility. That has played out. Bond yields spiked on fiscal concerns, then fell on growth fears and the U.S. Treasury’s pledge to lower them. China startup DeepSeek’s seeming AI breakthrough and U.S. tariff news have also stoked volatility. We think tariffs will be a key U.S. policy tool. The U.S. could pursue universal tariffs as a tax this week, with reports suggesting they could come as reciprocal tariffs matching those placed by other countries. We eye potential universal tariffs on a reciprocal basis or at a flat rate, such as 10%, with tariff levels of 25% serving as a negotiating tool. That could push the U.S. effective tariff rate near 1930s levels. See the chart. The macro impact of tariffs depends on their level, scope, duration and any retaliation. The risk of higher inflation and lower growth likely keeps the Federal Reserve on hold for now.\nU.S. equities have proved resilient this year, though escalating trade tensions could keep the pressure on in coming months. We think they can keep doing so, even with rolling tariff headlines and the potential for 10% blanket tariffs – provided growth holds up and inflation stays in check. Resilient growth, solid corporate earnings, potential deregulation and the AI theme keep us upbeat. Q4 earnings growth has broadened as we expected, with S&P 500 earnings excluding the “magnificent 7” stocks up about 5% from a year ago and the consensus eyeing a 10% rise this year, LSEG Datastream data show. We keep our tactical U.S. equity overweight yet watch for triggers for a change, such as earnings losing steam. We stay underweight long-term Treasuries. Even with the U.S. Treasury saying it aims to lower long-term yields, we see them rising anew as large fiscal deficits and persistent inflation cause investors to demand more compensation for the risk of holding bonds.\nEvolving our fixed income views\nTariff risks reinforce our preference for euro area government bonds, so we go tactically overweight. U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled potential tariffs on Europe. Europe’s reliance on the U.S. as an export destination means tariffs – and any retaliation – would hurt euro area growth more than it boosts inflation, in our view. In the UK, we cut our gilt allocation to neutral. We had expected more Bank of England rate cuts than markets were pricing. Recent volatility, especially revived fiscal concerns, pushed yields to 17-year highs. Yields have since retreated as we expected, providing a better exit point. Markets have moved closer to our view on BOE policy rates – and we think concerns about the UK fiscal outlook will linger.\nEmerging markets are especially vulnerable to the growth hit from tariffs and any worsening in global risk sentiment, we think. Mexico, with its heightened exposure to tariff impacts, is a key constituent in emerging market bond local currency indexes. We prefer to express heightened risks through fixed income, where we go underweight emerging market local currency debt. Tariff uncertainty could also drive volatility in currency markets and hurt returns in local currency EM debt.\nOur bottom line\nWe stay overweight U.S. equities on a solid macro backdrop and the AI theme. We upgrade euro area government bonds, trim UK gilts to neutral and go underweight emerging market local currency debt.\nMarket backdrop\nU.S. stocks were flat last week. Risk assets slid after the U.S. tariff plans before recovering by week’s end. Solid Q4 corporate earnings helped risk sentiment, with U.S. big tech companies reporting solid results and increasing their AI buildout spending. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields touched seven-week lows before settling near 4.50%. The U.S. jobs data showed a strong economy is keeping demand for workers high and leading to a renewed rise in wage pressures.\nWe get U.S. CPI for January this week. Even as December’s CPI report showed signs of inflation pressures easing, wage growth remains above the level that would allow inflation to recede back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, in our view. We see persistent services inflation forcing the Fed to keep rates higher for longer.\nWeek ahead\nSource\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results.

We tap into beneficiaries outside the tech sector. Robust economic growth, broad earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin our conviction and overweight in U.S. stocks versus other regions. We see valuations for big tech backed by strong earnings, and less lofty valuations for other sectors.\nJapanese equities\nA brighter outlook for Japan’s economy and corporate reforms are driving improved earnings and shareholder returns. Yet the potential drag on earnings from a stronger yen is a risk.\nSelective in fixed income\nPersistent deficits and sticky inflation in the U.S. make us more positive on fixed income elsewhere, notably Europe. We are underweight long-term U.S. Treasuries and like euro area government bonds instead. We also prefer European credit – both investment grade and high yield – over the U.S. on more attractive spreads.\nStrategic\nInfrastructure equity and private credit\nWe see opportunities in infrastructure equity due to attractive relative valuations and mega forces. We think private credit will earn lending share as banks retreat – and at attractive returns.\nFixed income granularity\nWe prefer short- and medium-term investment grade credit, which offers similar yields with less interest rate risk than long-dated credit. We also like short-term government bonds in the U.S. and euro area and UK gilts overall.\nEquity granularity\nWe favor emerging over developed markets yet get selective in both. EMs at the cross current of mega forces – like India and Saudi Arabia – offer opportunities. In DM, we like Japan as the return of inflation and corporate reforms brighten the outlook.\nSource\nNote: Views are from a U.S. dollar perspective, February 2025.

This information should not be relied upon by the reader as research or investment advice regarding any particular funds, strategy or security.\nTactical granular views\nSix to 12-month tactical views on selected assets vs. broad global asset classes by level of conviction,\nFebruary 2025\nOur approach is to first determine asset allocations based on our macro outlook – and what’s in the price. The table below reflects this. It leaves aside the opportunity for alpha, or the potential to generate above-benchmark returns. The new regime is not conducive to static exposures to broad asset classes, in our view, but it is creating more space for alpha. For example, the alpha opportunity in highly efficient DM equities markets historically has been low. That’s no longer the case, we think, thanks to greater volatility, macro uncertainty and dispersion of returns. The new regime puts a premium on insights and skill, in our view.\nSearch views\nAsset\nTactical view\nCommentary\nEquities\nUnited States\nWe are overweight as the AI theme and earnings growth broaden. Valuations for AI beneficiaries are supported by tech companies delivering on earnings. Resilient growth and Fed rate cuts support sentiment. Risks include any long-term yield surges or escalating trade protectionism.\nEurope\nWe are underweight. Valuations are fair. A growth pickup and European Central Bank rate cuts support a modest earnings recovery. Yet political uncertainty could keep investors cautious.\nU.K.\nWe are neutral. Political stability could improve investor sentiment. Yet an increase in the corporate tax burden could hurt profit margins near term.\nJapan\nWe are overweight. A brighter outlook for Japan’s economy and corporate reforms are driving improved earnings and shareholder returns. Yet a stronger yen dragging on earnings is a risk.\nEmerging markets\nWe are neutral. The growth and earnings outlook is mixed. We see valuations for India and Taiwan looking high.\nChina\nWe are modestly overweight. China’s fiscal stimulus is not yet enough to address the drags on growth and tariff risks could hurt sentiment. But we see stocks as attractively valued versus DMs. We stand ready to pivot. We are cautious long term given structural challenges.\nFixed income\nShort U.S. Treasuries\nWe are neutral. Markets are pricing in fewer Federal Reserve rate cuts and their policy rate expectations are now roughly in line with our views.\nLong U.S. Treasuries\nWe are underweight. Persistent budget deficits and geopolitical fragmentation could drive term premium up over the near term. We prefer intermediate maturities less vulnerable to investors demanding more term premium.\nGlobal inflation-linked bonds\nWe are neutral. We see higher medium-term inflation, but cooling inflation and growth may matter more near term.\nEuro area government bonds\nWe are overweight. Trade uncertainty may hurt euro area growth more than it boosts inflation, potentially allowing the European Central Bank to cut rates more. Political uncertainty remains a risk to fiscal sustainability.\nUK Gilts\nWe are neutral. Gilt yields are off their highs, but the risk of higher U.S. yields having a knock-on impact and reducing the UK’s fiscal space has risen. We are monitoring the UK fiscal situation.\nJapan government bonds\nWe are underweight. Stock returns look more attractive to us. We see some of the least attractive returns in JGBs.\nChina government bonds\nWe are neutral. Bonds are supported by looser policy. Yet we find yields more attractive in short-term DM paper.\nU.S. agency MBS\nWe are neutral. We see agency MBS as a high-quality exposure in a diversified bond allocation and prefer it to IG.\nShort-term IG credit\nWe are overweight. Short-term bonds better compensate for interest rate risk.\nLong-term IG credit\nWe are underweight. Spreads are tight, so we prefer taking risk in equities from a whole portfolio perspective. We prefer Europe over the U.S.\nGlobal high yield\nWe are neutral. Spreads are tight, but the total income makes it more attractive than IG. We prefer Europe.\nAsia credit\nWe are neutral. We don’t find valuations compelling enough to turn more positive.\nEmerging market - hard currency\nWe are neutral. The asset class has performed well due to its quality, attractive yields and EM central bank rate cuts. We think those rate cuts may soon be paused.\nEmerging market - local currency\nWe are underweight. We see emerging market currencies as especially sensitive to trade uncertainty and global risk sentiment.\nSource\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results.

Valuations are fair. A growth pickup and European Central Bank rate cuts support a modest earnings recovery. Yet geopolitical tensions, domestic political uncertainty, potential tariffs, and fading optimism about China’s stimulus could weigh on investor sentiment.\nGermany\nWe are underweight. Valuations and earnings momentum offer modest support compared to peers, especially as ECB rate cuts ease financing conditions. Prolonged uncertainty over the next government, potential tariffs, and fading optimism about China’s stimulus could dampen sentiment.\nFrance\nWe are underweight. The outcome of France’s parliamentary election and ongoing political uncertainty could weigh on business conditions for French companies. Yet, only a small share of the revenues and operations of major French firms is tied to domestic activity.\nItaly\nWe are underweight. Valuations are supportive relative to peers, but past growth and earnings outperformance largely stemmed from significant fiscal stimulus in 2022-2023, which is unlikely to be sustained in the coming years.\nSpain\nWe are neutral. Valuations and earnings momentum are supportive compared to other euro area stocks. The utilities sector stands to gain from an improving economic backdrop and advancements in AI.\nNetherlands\nWe are underweight. The Dutch stock market’s tilt to technology and semiconductors—key beneficiaries of rising AI demand—is offset by less favorable valuations and a weaker earnings outlook compared to European peers.\nSwitzerland\nWe are underweight, consistent with our broader European view. Earnings have improved, but valuations remain elevated compared to other European markets. The index’s defensive tilt may offer less support if global risk appetite stays strong.\nUK\nWe are neutral. Political stability could improve investor sentiment. Yet an increase in the corporate tax burden could hurt profit margins near term.\nFixed income\nEuro area government bonds\nWe are neutral. Market pricing aligns with our policy rate expectations, and 10-year yields have retreated from their highs. Political uncertainty poses risks to fiscal sustainability, but select peripheral markets are bolstered by stronger growth and improving credit ratings.\nGerman bunds\nWe are neutral. Market pricing aligns with our policy rate expectations, and 10-year yields have eased from their highs, partly due to growth concerns. We are watching the fiscal flexibility debate ahead of upcoming elections.\nFrench OATs\nWe are neutral. France faces challenges from elevated political uncertainty, persistent budget deficits, and a slower pace of structural reforms. The EU has already warned the country for breaching fiscal rules, and its sovereign credit rating was downgraded earlier this year.\nItalian BTPs\nWe are neutral. The spread over German bunds looks tight given its budget deficits and debt profile, prompting a warning from the EU. Other domestic factors remain supportive, with growth holding up relative to the rest of the euro area and Italian households showing solid demand to hold BTPs at higher yields.\nUK gilts\nWe are overweight. Gilt yields offer attractive income, and we think the Bank of England will cut rates more than the market is pricing given a soft economy. But we are monitoring any government response to the recent fiscal concerns.\nSwiss government bonds\nWe are neutral. The Swiss National Bank has cut policy rates this year as inflationary pressures eased but is unlikely to reduce rates significantly further.\nEuropean inflation-linked bonds\nWe are neutral. We see higher medium-term inflation, but cooling inflation and sluggish growth may matter more near term.\nEuropean investment grade credit\nWe are neutral on European investment grade credit, favoring short- to medium-term paper for quality income. We prefer European investment grade over the US, as spreads are relatively wider.\nEuropean high yield\nWe are overweight. The income potential is attractive, and we prefer European high yield for its more appealing valuations, higher quality, and shorter duration compared to the US. In our view, spreads adequately compensate for the risk of a potential rise in defaults.\nSource\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results.\nIt is not possible to invest directly in an index.
