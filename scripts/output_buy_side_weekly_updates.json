Rowe Price\nHome\nResources\nInsights\nGlobal markets weekly update\nmarkets & economy\n|  JANUARY 10, 2025\nGlobal markets weekly update\nU.S. labor market stronger than expected in December\nHighlighted Regions\nU.S.\nEurope\nJapan\nChina\nOther Key Markets\nU.S.\nInflation fears and political uncertainty send stocks lower\nU.S. equities declined during the week, which was shortened due to Thursday’s market closure in honor of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who recently passed away. Small-cap stocks underperformed their large-cap peers for the fifth week in the past six weeks, as the Russell 2000 Index dipped into correction territory on Friday morning. As measured by Russell 1000 indexes, value stocks held up better than their growth counterparts. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.34%, its biggest weekly drop since mid-November.\nThe week started on a positive note following a report that the incoming Trump administration’s proposed stance on tariffs was likely to be softer than previously indicated, which led to most indexes finishing higher on Monday. However, optimism faded throughout the week after President-elect Donald Trump refuted these reports and several pieces of economic data fueled concerns about stubborn inflation. T. Rowe Price traders noted that markets have been choppy to start the year, and they expect that to remain the case over the next several weeks as investors digest upcoming corporate earnings releases, the incoming administration’s policy proposals, and Federal Reserve outlook updates.\nResilient labor market and hawkish Fed minutes indicate a slower pace for rate cuts\nIn terms of economic data releases, on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported its Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)—a measure of economic activity in the services sector. The index came in at 54.1 for the month of December, two percentage points higher than November’s reading (readings above 50 indicate expansion). Notably, the component of the index that measures prices paid by services organizations for materials and services increased by 6.2 percentage points to 64.4, stoking fears that progress on bringing down inflation has stalled and that interest rates could remain “higher for longer.”\nAdding to these fears, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman noted in a speech on Thursday that inflation has held “uncomfortably above” the Fed’s 2% long-term target and that while the Fed made significant progress in 2023, there are still upside risks to inflation. Minutes from the Fed’s December policy meeting, released Wednesday, echoed this sentiment and indicated that most officials were comfortable holding rates steady at their upcoming meeting in January, as “almost all participants judged that upside risks to the inflation outlook had increased.”\nThe economic calendar wrapped up Friday morning with the Labor Department’s closely watched monthly nonfarm payrolls report for December. The report indicated that the U.S. economy added 256,000 jobs during the month, well ahead of consensus expectations for 155,000. The unemployment rate was little changed at 4.1%, and wages grew 3.9% year over year. The December data cap off a resilient year for U.S. labor markets despite facing several headwinds and seemingly provide Fed officials with another data point in favor of moderating the pace of rate cuts. Stocks turned sharply lower on Friday following the data release, solidifying the major indexes’ losses for the week.\nTreasury yields surge following jobs report\nU.S. Treasury yields were higher heading into Friday and jumped following the blowout jobs report, with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield touching its highest intraday level since November 2023 on Friday morning. (Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.)\nThere was also heavy issuance in the investment-grade corporate bond market through Thursday, with deals oversubscribed on average. Despite solid demand, spreads were wider amid a large amount of issuance. T. Rowe Price traders noted that utilities were in focus as wildfires tore through California. Our traders also noted that the high yield bond market was mixed and mostly traded in line with equities amid an unsettled backdrop.\nIndex\nFriday's Close\nWeek's Change\n% Change YTD\nDJIA\n41,938.45\n-793.68\n-1.42%\nS&P 500\n5,827.04\n-115.43\n-0.93%\nNasdaq Composite\n19,161.63\n-460.05\n-0.77%\nS&P MidCap 400\n3,099.47\n-52.67\n-0.69%\nRussell 2000\n2,189.23\n-79.24\n-1.84%\nThis chart is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the performance of any specific security.\nPast performance cannot guarantee future results.\nSource of data: Reuters, obtained through Yahoo!

Investors continue to expect the European Central Bank to cut interest rates in January despite a pickup in inflation. Italy’s FTSE MIB climbed 2.82%, Germany’s DAX gained 1.55%, and France’s CAC 40 Index added 2.04%. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index tacked on 0.30%.\nUK bond market roiled by Trump, Fed, and UK fiscal concerns\nIn the UK, the Treasury tried to calm markets and reaffirmed its commitment to fiscal rules after a sell-off in the pound sterling and UK government bonds, which propelled the 10-year gilt yield to 4.8%, the highest level since August 2008. The move reflected a broader increase in bond yields stoked by concerns over President-elect Donald Trump’s policies and a more hawkish outlook for U.S. interest rates. Mounting investor concerns about the UK’s debt levels and the Labour government’s ability to shore up the public finances while implementing budget plans added to the upward pressure on gilt yields.\nThe Times of London\nreported that Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, the UK finance minister, asked colleagues at a Cabinet meeting to come up with ideas to boost economic growth.\nEuro area inflation exceeds 2% target again\nA flurry of data points painted a mixed picture of the eurozone economy. Year-over-year inflation accelerated in December to 2.4%, from 2.2% in November, driven by higher energy prices and services costs. The core rate, which excludes energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco prices, steadied at 2.7%. Retail sales barely grew in November, after falling in October. Meanwhile, the jobless rate stayed at a record low of 6.3% in November.\nECB says inflation on track to hit target; doves back more rate cuts\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) said in its latest Economic Bulletin that the disinflation process was well on track and highlighted that most measures of underlying inflation suggested inflation would settle at the ECB’s 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. Separately, policymaker Piero Cipollone was quoted by Italian newspaper\nCorriere della Sera\nas saying that the ECB “shouldn’t try to guard excessively against possible future inflation shocks” and that “running the economy below potential weakens it and reduces the scope to react to shocks when they occur.” His colleague Francois Villeroy said in a speech to the French central bank, \"If the pullback in inflation is confirmed in the coming quarters as we expect, common sense would have us heading towards the neutral rate without slowing the pace by summer.\"\nReturn to Top\nJapan\nJapan’s stock markets lost ground over the week, with the Nikkei 225 Index falling 1.8% and the broader TOPIX Index down 2.5%. Speculation continued about the timing of the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ’s) next interest rate hike.\nIn the currency markets, the yen weakened to around JPY 158.1 against the U.S. dollar, from about 157.3 at the end of the prior week. The weakness of the Japanese currency was attributable to both uncertainty about the pace of further monetary policy normalization by the BoJ and pressure from a recent widening of the U.S.-Japan interest rate differential. Japan’s Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato issued a verbal warning about speculative, one-sided moves in the currency markets, signaling authorities’ readiness to take appropriate action against excessive moves. Japanese authorities have in the past intervened in the foreign exchange markets to prop up the yen, most recently in July 2024.\nWithin fixed income, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) rose to 1.19%, from 1.09% at the end of the previous week, reaching its highest level since 2011. JGB yields tracked U.S. Treasury yields higher as expectations strengthened around fewer Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.\nOngoing speculation about timing of Bank of Japan’s next rate hike\nThe BoJ and its governor, Kazuo Ueda, maintained their tightening bias. Ueda reiterated that rates will be raised if economic and price conditions keep improving. However, recent comments have highlighted concerns around U.S. economic policies (tariffs and fiscal policy), and the language appears unlikely to meet the bar to indicate a hike at the central bank’s January monetary policy meeting. Some investors believe this raises the probability that an increase in the policy rate will be delayed until March or April.\nJapan’s real (inflation-adjusted) wage growth, a key indicator of consumers’ purchasing power that is closely watched by the BoJ, fell 0.3% year on year in November. This marked the fourth consecutive month of negative real wage growth. The central bank’s base case is that if the economy and prices (as well as wage growth) develop in line with its projections, it will raise interest rates.\nReturn to Top\nChina\nChinese stocks fell as data showed that the economy remained stuck in deflation. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.34%, while the blue chip CSI 300 gave up 1.13%. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 3.52%, according to FactSet.\nInflation data released Thursday showed that China is still grappling with deflationary pressures. The consumer price index rose 0.1% in December from a year earlier, in line with estimates and down from 0.2% in November amid lower food and fuel prices. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, ticked up to 0.4% from November’s 0.3% rise. The producer price index declined 2.3% year on year, slowing from the prior month’s 2.5% drop and extending the deflation in factory gate prices for the 27th consecutive month.\nIn other news, the private Caixin/S&P Global survey of services activity rose to a better-than-expected 52.2 in December, the highest level since May. The reading matched official data released the prior week showing that nonmanufacturing activity rose to 52.2 in December—the highest level in nine months—after Beijing rolled out a broad stimulus package in late September.\nIn a statement following its quarterly policy meeting, The People’s Bank of China said that it will implement a moderately loose monetary policy this year to support economic growth. The central bank pledged to increase financial support for the technology, emissions, pensions, and digital sectors. It also announced that it will reduce the reserve requirement ratio and interest rates when appropriate to boost consumption.\nReturn to Top\nOther Key Markets\nMexico\nInflation data in line with expectations; central bank could seek further rate cuts\nEarlier in the week, the Mexican government reported that headline inflation in December was measured at a month-over-month rate of 0.4% and a year-over-year rate of 4.2%, while core inflation was measured at 0.5% month over month and 3.7% year over year. The data were generally in line with expectations.\nAccording to T. Rowe Price emerging markets sovereign analyst Aaron Gifford, core inflation ticked up on an annual basis slightly versus the 3.6% year-over-year November reading, while headline inflation fell from a year-over-year November measurement of 4.6%. He believes that the data were influenced by a drop in agricultural prices and a slight rise in core goods and services, likely on the back of a reversal of Black Friday sales in November and holiday-related demand in December. With sequential inflation (the three-month seasonally adjusted annual rate) running well within the central bank’s 2% to 4% inflation target range, Gifford believes that the central bank could continue reducing short-term interest rates despite external pressures, such as a stronger U.S. dollar and rising U.S. Treasury yields. In fact, in the minutes from the central bank’s December monetary policy meeting—at which Governing Board members unanimously agreed to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 10.00%—the majority of the board discussed the potential for larger reductions going forward.\nPeru\nPolicymakers reduce rates, signal end of rate-cutting cycle\nOn Thursday, Peru’s central bank held its scheduled monetary policy meeting, and policymakers decided to reduce the reference rate from 5.00% to 4.75%. The decision was a surprise to some investors.\nAccording to the post-meeting statement, policymakers considered several factors that influenced their decision. For example, they noted that between November and December, year-over-year inflation decreased from 2.3% to 2.0%, which is the midpoint of the central bank’s inflation target range. They also noted that one-year-ahead inflation expectations were slightly below 2.5% in December, and that both year-over-year headline inflation and core inflation are expected to stay in the target range over the forecast horizon. In addition, policymakers acknowledged that many “indicators of economic activity expectations” deteriorated in December, although they remained in “optimistic territory.”\nPolicymakers signaled that their rate-cutting efforts are nearing an end, as they stated that the reference rate “is approaching the level estimated as neutral,” which is neither stimulative nor restrictive. However, they did not completely rule out additional rate cuts, stating that reference rate adjustments in the future “will be conditional on new information about inflation and its determinants.”\nImportant Information\nThis material is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended to be investment advice or a recommendation to take any particular investment action.\nThe views are as of the date written and are subject to change without notice; these views may differ from those of other T. Rowe Price affiliated companies and/or associates.\nThis information is not intended to reflect a current or past recommendation concerning investments, investment strategies, or account types, advice of any kind, or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or investment services.

        "content": "Weekly Stock Market Update | Edward Jones\nUnited States | English\nCanada | English\nCanada | French\nWeekly market wrap\nPublished\tJan. 10, 2025\nPublished\tJanuary 10, 2025\nMona Mahajan\nShare:\nShare on LinkedIn\nShare on Facebook\n2025 kicks off with solid fundamentals, even as political shifts are underway\nKey Takeaways:\nIn both the U.S. and Canada, the economic fundamentals heading into 2025 were resilient. Real GDP (gross domestic product) growth was positive, inflation remained contained, and central banks were moving interest rates lower.\nThis past week, the data confirmed a continuation of this positive economic trend. The December labor market data in both economies surprised to the upside. Notably, wage gains continue to outpace inflation rates, a positive for consumers and sentiment.\nHowever, with economic strength improving, the odds of further central-bank rate cuts have moved lower. As a result, government bond yields moved higher last week, and stock markets declined. While higher rates may put pressure on valuations and spark some bouts of volatility, we believe the bull market remains supported, especially as we see earnings growth continuing to deliver in the year ahead.\nBoth economies also face shifts in political regimes in the weeks ahead. In the U.S., inauguration day for President-elect Trump is on January 20. All eyes remain on which policies the new administration will choose to prioritize, including immigration, energy reform, tariffs and taxes.\nIn Canada, this past week, Prime Minister Trudeau announced his resignation and halted Parliament operations through March 24. However, this resignation had been largely speculated since mid-December, and Trudeau will remain in power until a new leader of the Liberal Party is selected.\nOverall, history has shown us that political headlines alone do not drive markets. Instead, financial markets take cues from fundamentals, including economic and earnings growth and central-bank policy. In our view, the economic and labor-market fundamentals in the U.S. and Canada remain resilient, and central banks are still poised to move rates lower, albeit more modestly so. We believe volatility may remain elevated while political and policy uncertainty is resolved, but pullbacks can be used as opportunities for investors amid the ongoing economic and earnings expansion.\nFundamentals intact: The labor market is off to a strong start in 2025\nThe first jobs reports of 2025 in both the U.S. and Canada exceeded expectations. In the U.S., nonfarm payrolls for December came in at 256,000, well above expectations of 165,000, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% from 4.2%.* Average hourly wage growth rose 3.9% year-over-year, slightly below forecasts of 4.0% wage growth, signaling a bit of potential easing in services inflation as well.*\nThe story around the jobs data was similar in Canada. Total net change in jobs for December came in around 91,000, well above expectations of 25,000, and the unemployment rate fell to 6.7% from 6.8% last month.* Wage gains in Canada also eased to 3.7% year-over-year, below estimates of 3.8%, supporting better inflationary trends broadly.\nOverall, the employment data points to two key positive trends for economic growth. First, the unemployment rate in both economies remains benign and well below long-term historical unemployment rates. This provides a supportive backdrop for both consumers and businesses to operate. Second, wage gains still exceed the rate of inflation in both the U.S. and Canada, which means employees are taking home positive real wages. This is supportive of consumer confidence and spending as well.\nSource: Bloomberg.\nChart description\nThis chart shows the level of the U.S. and Canadian unemployment rate.

Wages have outpaced inflation in both countries in recent months.\nWhy were financial markets negative after this news? Repricing of central-bank rate cuts\nAlthough the jobs reports were positive, the reaction in the financial markets was largely negative after this news. This was in part because markets are reassessing the need for further central-bank rate cuts. In fact, according to the CME FedWatch tool, markets now expect just one more Fed rate cut in 2025, in the July timeframe, which would bring the fed funds rate to 4.0% - 4.25%. Similarly, the probability of a January rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC) decreased after the jobs data too.\nSource: CME FedWatch Tool.\nChart description\nThis chart shows that futures markets now expect only one 0.25% Fed rate cut in 2025.\nSource: CME FedWatch Tool.\nThis chart shows that futures markets now expect only one 0.25% Fed rate cut in 2025.\nAs a result, government bond yields moved sharply higher, especially short-term government yields, which tend to be more driven by central-bank policy rates. The higher yields weighed on stocks, particularly those parts of the market with the highest valuations. In the U.S. markets, the technology-heavy Nasdaq underperformed, while defensive parts of the market like utilities and health care held up better. In our view, maintaining a diversified approach to both growth and value investments in portfolios will be an ongoing theme for the year ahead.\nBoth the U.S. and Canada face new political regimes in the months ahead\nIn addition to the economic data and central-bank rate cuts, investors also have their eye on the shift in political regimes occurring in both the U.S. and Canada.\nThe U.S. is waiting for clarity around policy initiatives after Inauguration Day\nIn the U.S., Inauguration Day is less than two weeks away, with President-elect Trump taking the oath of office on January 20. While the incoming administration has highlighted several policy initiatives – including tariffs, immigration and energy reform, deregulation and tax cuts – it remains to be seen which of these are prioritized in the weeks ahead.\nThe uncertainty around which policies are prioritized, and in what order, may continue to remain an overhang on markets. If the administration focuses on some of the more potentially inflationary policies first, like tariffs and immigration reform, this could be more disruptive for markets. However, if these are balanced with pro-growth initiatives like deregulation and tax cuts, we could also see a more balanced outcome in markets. Overall, though, the removal of this policy uncertainty alone may be welcomed by the markets, regardless of the initiatives that are prioritized.\nIn Canada, Prime Minister Trudeau announces his intent to resign\nOn January 6, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that he will resign as prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party once a suitable replacement has been chosen to succeed him. With that announcement, he also prorogued or suspended Parliament until March 24.\nThis move has been widely speculated since mid-December when the then minister of finance, Chrystia Freeland, resigned. However, this announcement comes at a time when proposed legislation (including an increase to the capital-gains inclusion rate and extending the 2024 charitable-donation deadline) has not yet been passed into law. The Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA), however, has stated that it will enforce the proposed capital-gains inclusion-rate change given the practice of the CRA to administer any previously proposed legislation when Parliament is prorogued.\nMore broadly, a Canadian federal election is set to occur in 2025, either on October 20, 2025, or earlier if the Liberal government loses a nonconfidence vote once Parliament returns. Current polling suggests that the Conservative Party in Canada maintains a sizable lead, although polls may shift as the political race unfolds.\nReminder – politics don't drive financial markets, fundamentals do\nOverall, while there is ongoing uncertainty in the political backdrop both in the U.S. and Canada, now is a good reminder that financial markets tend not to be driven by politics and headlines, but by fundamentals.\nWe continue to see the economic and market expansion being supported by three key fundamental factors: A solid labor market, which continues to support consumption; positive S&P 500 earnings growth, which will likely reach over 10% in 2025; and central banks that will still move policy rates lower from here, albeit perhaps more modestly so.\nRemember, after two back-to-back years of solid gains in the U.S. and Canadian markets, and low volatility during this period, we would expect to see some moderation in returns and bouts of increased market volatility ahead. However, we continue to believe that investors can use these pullbacks as opportunities, to diversify, rebalance and add quality investments at better prices, across both growth and value parts of the market.\nAs we kick off 2025, now is a great time to connect with your financial advisor (or consider partnering with one), to discuss your personalized financial goals, risk preferences, and how to optimize investment allocations for the year ahead and beyond.\nSource: Morningstar Direct, Slickcharts, Edward Jones.

The recent spike reflects growing market expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may only approve a single rate cut this year.\nJobs strength\nThe U.S. labor market remains resilient, as December’s jobs gain of 256,000 was roughly 100,000 more than most economists had expected. The result capped a year that generated an average monthly gain of 186,000 jobs. December’s unemployment rate slipped to 4.1% from 4.2% the previous month.\nEarnings outlook\nAs major banks prepare to open quarterly earnings season, analysts on Friday expected that fourth-quarter earnings per share for all companies in the S&P 500 rose by an average of 11.7%, according to FactSet. The firm reported that 71 companies recently scaled back their earnings expectations versus 35 that issued positive guidance.\nOil and gold gains\nThe price of U.S. crude oil rose for the third week in a row, climbing to nearly $77 on Friday. Over that three-week stretch, the price was up more than 10%. Gold futures rose for the second week in a row, reaching around $2,717—less than 3% shy of the record level reached two and a half months ago.\nU.K. yield surge\nYields of the United Kingdom’s debt jumped to their highest levels in decades amid worries about government borrowing and economic weakness. On Thursday, the yield on the 30-year gilt hit more than 5.45%, the highest since 1998. The yield of the 10-year gilt reached 4.92%, the highest since 2008.\nDividend increases\nDividend payments by companies in the S&P 500 rose in 2024. The net indicated dividend rate—dividend increases announced by companies minus decreases—rose to $53.3 billion from $36.5 billion in 2023, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The firm’s annual forecast projects an 8% increase in overall dividend payments this year relative to 2024.\nCPI ahead\nA Consumer Price Index report scheduled for release on Wednesday will show whether a recent trend of slightly hotter-than-expected inflation extended into December.  Last month’s CPI report showed an annual rate of 2.7% in November, up from 2.6% the previous month—a further indication of recently uneven progress in bringing inflation closer to the Fed’s 2.0% long-term target.\nThe week ahead: January 13-17\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\nFederal budget,

Market take\nCamera frame\nWe think U.S. equity gains stay strong. Yet an economic transformation and global policy changes could spur volatility.\nThat calls for outlining triggers for adjusting our views.\nTitle slide:\nTriggers to change our pro-risk view\n1:\nTracking U.S. policy changes\nFirst, we’re focusing on how U.S. trade, fiscal and regulatory policy changes take shape.\nIn a market-friendly approach, rolling back banking regulation could boost economic growth and risk asset gains. Efforts to reduce deficits could encourage other countries to loosen fiscal policy.\nYet plans to extend tax cuts plus broad and large-scale tariffs could support market less by bolstering deficits and inflation.\n2:\nEagerly awaiting earnings\nWe’re also watching how investor sentiment could respond to corporate earnings results and lofty tech valuations.\nWe expect earnings growth to keep broadening beyond tech. Yet the “magnificent seven” are still expected to drive overall earnings.\n3:\nBond market blues\nFinally, we’re monitoring vulnerabilities in public markets – including an already jittery bond market.\nIt’s unclear how well markets can absorb record U.S. Treasury issuance that has helped drive term premium to its highest level in a decade.\nOutro: Here’s our Market take\nWe see U.S. equity performance cooling from its highs this year but still staying strong, while U.S. Treasury yields will climb due to rising term premium.\nThat supports our overweight to U.S. stocks and underweight to long-term Treasuries.\nClosing frame: Read details:\nblackrock.com/weekly-commentary\nThree triggers\nWe are pro-risk to start 2025. Yet we’re ready to evolve our view if policy shifts, corporate earnings and financial market cracks spell a deteriorating outlook.\nMarket backdrop\nU.S. stocks slid and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbed near 4.80% last week after a strong U.S. jobs report. UK gilt yields jumped on fiscal outlook concerns.\nWeek ahead\nWe get U.S. CPI this week. Robust wage growth and sticky core services inflation should keep broad inflation from falling to the Federal Reserve’s target, we think.\nWe are pro-risk, with the biggest overweight in U.S. stocks, yet eye three areas that could spur a view change. First, we’re watching policy, notably how U.S. tariffs and fiscal policy shape up. Second, we watch whether investor risk appetite will sour due to corporate earnings and lofty tech valuations amid the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout. Third, we look for elevated vulnerabilities, like surging bond yields as markets price out rate cuts and corporate debt refinancing at higher interest rates.\nDownload full commentary (PDF)\nMarket commentary\nAsset class views\nParagraph-2,Paragraph-3,Image-1,Paragraph-4\nParagraph-5,Advance Static Table-1,Paragraph-6,Advance Static Table-2,Paragraph-7,Advance Static Table-3,Paragraph-8,Advance Static Table-4\nGoing up\nChange in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields through rate cutting episodes, 1984-2024\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results.\nSource: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Haver Analytics, January 2025. Note: The chart shows the change in 10-year Treasury yields through periods when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. The shaded area shows the range of those changes since 1984 and the dotted green line shows the average. The orange line shows the change in yields since the Fed’s cut in September 2024.\nWe upped our U.S. equities overweight in December as we expected AI beneficiaries to broaden beyond tech given resilient growth and Fed rate cuts. We think U.S. equity gains could roll on. Yet an economic transformation and global policy shifts could push markets and economies into a new scenario from our 2025 Outlook. We look through near-term noise but outline triggers for adjusting our views, by either dialing down risk or shifting our preferences. First, we’re tracking the impacts of global policy – especially U.S. trade, fiscal and regulatory policy. Second, we gauge whether risk appetite will stay upbeat as earnings results for AI beneficiaries come in and given high tech valuations. Third, vulnerabilities like a sudden jump in bond yields could also shift our view. The unusual yield jump since the Fed started cutting rates underscores this is a very different environment. See the chart.\nThe first trigger to change our view is whether or not President-elect Donald Trump takes a market-friendly approach to achieve goals like improving growth and reducing budget deficits. In a market-friendly approach, rolling back financial regulation and cutting government spending could boost economic growth and risk assets. That, plus efforts to rebalance global trade and expand fiscal stimulus in countries where investment and consumer spending have lagged the U.S., may help address trade deficit worries. In a less market-friendly approach, plans to extend tax cuts alongside large-scale tariffs could deepen deficits and stoke inflation. More broad-based tariffs could strengthen the U.S. dollar, fuel inflation and call for high-for-longer interest rates. This plan would clash with Trump’s calls for a weaker dollar to boost U.S. manufacturing and his push for rate cuts. We look through noisy headlines around policy and focus on how policy changes take shape this year.\nSentiment and financial cracks\nThe second trigger: deteriorating investor sentiment due to earnings misses or lofty tech valuations. The “magnificent seven” of mostly tech companies are still expected to drive earnings this year as they lead the AI buildout. Their lead should narrow as resilient consumer spending and potential deregulation support earnings beyond tech. While earnings might surprise to the upside, any misses could renew investor concern over whether big AI capital spending will pay off and if high valuations are justified – even if we think valuations can’t be viewed through a historical lens as an economic transformation unfolds.\nIn our third trigger, we’re watching for elevated vulnerabilities in financial markets – including an already jittery bond market. We expect bond yields to climb further as investors demand more term premium for the risk of holding bonds. Term premium is rising from negative levels and is at its highest in a decade, LSEG Datastream data show. The surge in UK gilt yields shows how concerns about fiscal policy can drive term premium – and bond yields – higher. The refinancing of corporate debt at higher interest rates is another risk. It could challenge the business models of companies that assumed interest rates would remain low. But many companies have refinanced debt without defaulting since the pandemic given strong balance sheets.\nOur bottom line\nWe see U.S. equity gains cooling from their highs this year but staying strong, while U.S. Treasury yields climb. We stay overweight U.S. stocks and underweight long-term Treasuries, yet we’re watching triggers to change our views.\nMarket backdrop\nU.S. stocks fell more than 1% last week. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields climbed near 4.80%, to a 14-month high and near their 2023 peak partly due to a surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report. The data suggest immigration is still making it possible to sustain larger job gains without adding to wage pressures. Yet wage gains are still strong enough for the Fed to keep policy rates higher for longer. UK 30-year gilts yields hit their highest in almost three decades on concerns about the UK fiscal path.\nU.S. CPI is in store this week. We watch for whether inflation stays sticky in line with the recent trend. Wage growth and core services inflation remain at a level inconsistent with overall inflation falling back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, in our view. Longer term, we think labor supply constraints like population aging should keep inflation sticky, preventing the Fed from cutting policy rates much below 4% – much higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nWeek ahead\nSource\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results.

We tap into beneficiaries outside the tech sector. Robust economic growth, broad earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin our conviction and overweight in U.S. stocks versus other regions. We see valuations for big tech backed by strong earnings, and less lofty valuations for other sectors.\nJapanese equities\nA brighter outlook for Japan’s economy and corporate reforms are driving improved earnings and shareholder returns. Yet the potential drag on earnings from a stronger yen is a risk.\nSelective in fixed income\nPersistent deficits and sticky inflation in the U.S. make us more positive on fixed income elsewhere, notably Europe. We are underweight long-term U.S. Treasuries and like UK gilts instead. We also prefer European credit – both investment grade and high yield – over the U.S. on cheaper valuations.\nStrategic\nInfrastructure equity and private credit\nWe see opportunities in infrastructure equity due to attractive relative valuations and mega forces. We think private credit will earn lending share as banks retreat – and at attractive returns.\nFixed income granularity\nWe prefer short- and medium-term investment grade credit, which offers similar yields with less interest rate risk than long-dated credit. We also like short-term government bonds in the U.S. and euro area and UK gilts overall.\nEquity granularity\nWe favor emerging over developed markets yet get selective in both. EMs at the cross current of mega forces – like India and Saudi Arabia – offer opportunities. In DM, we like Japan as the return of inflation and corporate reforms brighten the outlook.\nSource\nNote: Views are from a U.S. dollar perspective, January 2025.

This information should not be relied upon by the reader as research or investment advice regarding any particular funds, strategy or security.\nTactical granular views\nSix to 12-month tactical views on selected assets vs. broad global asset classes by level of conviction,\nJanuary 2025\nOur approach is to first determine asset allocations based on our macro outlook – and what’s in the price. The table below reflects this. It leaves aside the opportunity for alpha, or the potential to generate above-benchmark returns. The new regime is not conducive to static exposures to broad asset classes, in our view, but it is creating more space for alpha. For example, the alpha opportunity in highly efficient DM equities markets historically has been low. That’s no longer the case, we think, thanks to greater volatility, macro uncertainty and dispersion of returns. The new regime puts a premium on insights and skill, in our view.\nSearch views\nAsset\nTactical view\nCommentary\nEquities\nUnited States\nWe are overweight as the AI theme and earnings growth broaden. Valuations for AI beneficiaries are supported by tech companies delivering on earnings. Resilient growth and Fed rate cuts support sentiment. Risks include any long-term yield surges or escalating trade protectionism.\nEurope\nWe are underweight. Valuations are fair. A growth pickup and European Central Bank rate cuts support a modest earnings recovery. Yet political uncertainty could keep investors cautious.\nU.K.\nWe are neutral. Political stability could improve investor sentiment. Yet an increase in the corporate tax burden could hurt profit margins near term.\nJapan\nWe are overweight. A brighter outlook for Japan’s economy and corporate reforms are driving improved earnings and shareholder returns. Yet a stronger yen dragging on earnings is a risk.\nEmerging markets\nWe are neutral. The growth and earnings outlook is mixed. We see valuations for India and Taiwan looking high.\nChina\nWe are modestly overweight. China’s fiscal stimulus is not yet enough to address the drags on economic growth, but we think stocks are at attractive valuations to DM shares. We stand ready to pivot. We are cautious long term given China’s structural challenges.\nFixed income\nShort U.S. Treasuries\nWe are neutral. Markets are pricing in fewer Federal Reserve rate cuts and their policy rate expectations are now roughly in line with our views.\nLong U.S. Treasuries\nWe are underweight. Persistent budget deficits and geopolitical fragmentation could drive term premium up over the near term. We prefer intermediate maturities less vulnerable to investors demanding more term premium.\nGlobal inflation-linked bonds\nWe are neutral. We see higher medium-term inflation, but cooling inflation and growth may matter more near term.\nEuro area government bonds\nWe are neutral. Market pricing reflects policy rates in line with our expectations and 10-year yields are off their highs. Political uncertainty remains a risk to fiscal sustainability.\nUK Gilts\nWe are overweight. Gilt yields offer attractive income, and we think the Bank of England will cut rates more than the market is pricing given a soft economy. But we are monitoring any government response to the recent fiscal concerns.\nJapan government bonds\nWe are underweight. Stock returns look more attractive to us. We see some of the least attractive returns in JGBs.\nChina government bonds\nWe are neutral. Bonds are supported by looser policy. Yet we find yields more attractive in short-term DM paper.\nU.S. agency MBS\nWe are neutral. We see agency MBS as a high-quality exposure in a diversified bond allocation and prefer it to IG.\nShort-term IG credit\nWe are overweight. Short-term bonds better compensate for interest rate risk.\nLong-term IG credit\nWe are underweight. Spreads are tight, so we prefer taking risk in equities from a whole portfolio perspective. We prefer Europe over the U.S.\nGlobal high yield\nWe are neutral. Spreads are tight, but the total income makes it more attractive than IG. We prefer Europe.\nAsia credit\nWe are neutral. We don’t find valuations compelling enough to turn more positive.\nEmerging market - hard currency\nWe are neutral. The asset class has performed well due to its quality, attractive yields and EM central bank rate cuts. We think those rate cuts may soon be paused.\nEmerging market - local currency\nWe are neutral. Yields have fallen closer to U.S. Treasury yields, and EM central banks look to be turning more cautious after cutting policy rates sharply.\nSource\nPast performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results.

Valuations are fair. A growth pickup and European Central Bank rate cuts support a modest earnings recovery. Yet geopolitical tensions, domestic political uncertainty, potential tariffs, and fading optimism about China’s stimulus could weigh on investor sentiment.\nGermany\nWe are underweight. Valuations and earnings momentum offer modest support compared to peers, especially as ECB rate cuts ease financing conditions. Prolonged uncertainty over the next government, potential tariffs, and fading optimism about China’s stimulus could dampen sentiment.\nFrance\nWe are underweight. The outcome of France’s parliamentary election and ongoing political uncertainty could weigh on business conditions for French companies. Yet, only a small share of the revenues and operations of major French firms is tied to domestic activity.\nItaly\nWe are underweight. Valuations are supportive relative to peers, but past growth and earnings outperformance largely stemmed from significant fiscal stimulus in 2022-2023, which is unlikely to be sustained in the coming years.\nSpain\nWe are neutral. Valuations and earnings momentum are supportive compared to other euro area stocks. The utilities sector stands to gain from an improving economic backdrop and advancements in AI.\nNetherlands\nWe are underweight. The Dutch stock market’s tilt to technology and semiconductors—key beneficiaries of rising AI demand—is offset by less favorable valuations and a weaker earnings outlook compared to European peers.\nSwitzerland\nWe are underweight, consistent with our broader European view. Earnings have improved, but valuations remain elevated compared to other European markets. The index’s defensive tilt may offer less support if global risk appetite stays strong.\nUK\nWe are neutral. Political stability could improve investor sentiment. Yet an increase in the corporate tax burden could hurt profit margins near term.\nFixed income\nEuro area government bonds\nWe are neutral. Market pricing aligns with our policy rate expectations, and 10-year yields have retreated from their highs. Political uncertainty poses risks to fiscal sustainability, but select peripheral markets are bolstered by stronger growth and improving credit ratings.\nGerman bunds\nWe are neutral. Market pricing aligns with our policy rate expectations, and 10-year yields have eased from their highs, partly due to growth concerns. We are watching the fiscal flexibility debate ahead of upcoming elections.\nFrench OATs\nWe are neutral. France faces challenges from elevated political uncertainty, persistent budget deficits, and a slower pace of structural reforms. The EU has already warned the country for breaching fiscal rules, and its sovereign credit rating was downgraded earlier this year.\nItalian BTPs\nWe are neutral. The spread over German bunds looks tight given its budget deficits and debt profile, prompting a warning from the EU. Other domestic factors remain supportive, with growth holding up relative to the rest of the euro area and Italian households showing solid demand to hold BTPs at higher yields.\nUK gilts\nWe are overweight. Gilt yields offer attractive income, and we think the Bank of England will cut rates more than the market is pricing given a soft economy. But we are monitoring any government response to the recent fiscal concerns.\nSwiss government bonds\nWe are neutral. The Swiss National Bank has cut policy rates this year as inflationary pressures eased but is unlikely to reduce rates significantly further.\nEuropean inflation-linked bonds\nWe are neutral. We see higher medium-term inflation, but cooling inflation and sluggish growth may matter more near term.\nEuropean investment grade credit\nWe are neutral on European investment grade credit, favoring short- to medium-term paper for quality income. We prefer European investment grade over the US, as spreads are relatively wider.\nEuropean high yield\nWe are overweight. The income potential is attractive, and we prefer European high yield for its more appealing valuations, higher quality, and shorter duration compared to the US.
